(1)  Sexual assault by persons in custody against
other persons in custody of the department;
(2)  Sexual assault by correctional staff against
persons in custody of the department;
(3)  Non-criminal sexual misconduct by staff,
including sexual harassment of persons in custody of the department;
(4)  Criminal cases initiated, and closed by
dismissal, plea, or verdict, for sexual assaults by or upon a person in custody
of the department; and
(5)  Civil claims filed and closed by dismissal,
settlement, or verdict for sexual assaults by or upon a person in custody of
the department.
(c)  The department shall preserve any forensic
evidence consisting of human biological specimens for collection by the
relevant criminal investigation entity or coroner, if there is any indication
of sexual assault leading to the death of any:
(1)  Correctional facility or community correctional
center employee who dies on the grounds of a correctional facility or community
