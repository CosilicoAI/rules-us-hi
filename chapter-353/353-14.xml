            <p>§353-14  Cash furnished discharged committed
person, when.
(a)
Upon the discharge or parole of any committed
person who has undergone a commitment or sentence of more than one year, the
committed person may be furnished by the Hawaii paroling authority, in its
discretion, with funds of not more than $200, to meet the committed person's
immediate needs; provided that legislative appropriations for this specific
purpose have been authorized and allocated to the authority.  The expenditures
made by the Hawaii paroling authority shall be included among the accounts for
cost and maintenance of committed persons.
(b)  The Hawaii paroling authority shall not
use any moneys appropriated pursuant to subsection (a) for any purpose other
than to meet a committed person's immediate needs. [L 1987, c 338, pt of §3; am
L 1997, c 174, §1; am L 2018, c 79, §1]
Case Notes
Denial of &quot;gate money&quot; where parole board
determined that plaintiffs had no immediate needs satisfied rational basis
test; thus, there was no equal protection violation.  940 F. Supp. 1523 (1996).
Section (1987) provided Hawaii paroling authority board [sic]
with complete discretion to assess inmates' needs and to award &quot;gate
money&quot; as necessary in light of those needs; thus, no protected property
interest existed. The right to &quot;gate money&quot; not so fundamental as to
warrant constitutional protection apart from its status under state law.  940
F. Supp. 1523 (1996).
Where plaintiffs argued that State waived its Eleventh
Amendment immunity through the enactment of this section and State's Tort
Claims Act [sic], §§662‑2 and 663‑1, no express consent or applicable waiver
provisions found.  940 F. Supp. 1523 (1996).
