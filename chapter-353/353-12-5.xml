            <p>§353-12  Correctional records, documents.
The director shall establish a record of all facts relating to the admission,
sentence, commutation, parole, pardon, discharge, escape, death, and
correctional programs of any committed person, all actions that are taken for
breach of correctional rules, and all other occurrences of note concerning the
committed person.
The director or a designated agent shall file
all warrants, mittimuses, processes, and other official papers, or the attested
copies of them, by which any committed person has been committed, paroled,
liberated, or retaken and they shall be safely kept in a suitable box or safe. 
Upon the death, resignation, or removal from office of the person so having
custody of the papers, they shall be delivered, together with all other
official records, papers, and journals, to the person's successor or to any other
officer or person duly appointed to receive them.  In default of such delivery
the director or a designated agent, as the case may be, if living, may be held
liable for theft as provided by section 708
-
830, and shall also be
civilly liable in damages to any other person who is injured by such
nondelivery.  If the director or agent, as the case may be, is dead, the civil
liability shall attach to such person's personal representatives and the
sureties upon such person's official bond, if any has been required jointly and
severally.  In addition to the civil liability, the person or the person's
personal representatives and sureties on the official bond shall forfeit and
pay for each such default in delivery the sum of $200 to be recovered for the
use of the general fund of the State. [L 1987, c 338, pt of §3]
