            <p>§390-2  Employment of minors under eighteen
years of age.
(a)  No minor under eighteen years of age shall be employed
or permitted to work in, about, or in connection with any gainful occupation at
any time except as otherwise provided in this section.  In no event, however,
shall the minor be permitted to be employed or permitted to work in, about, or
in connection with adult entertainment or any gainful occupation prohibited by
law or which has been declared by rule of the director to be hazardous for the
minor.
(b)  A minor who has attained the age of
sixteen years but not eighteen years may be employed during periods when the
minor is not legally required to attend school or when the minor is excused by
school authorities from attending school; provided that the employer of the
minor records and keeps on file the number of a valid certificate of age issued
to the minor by the department.
(c)  A minor who has attained the age of
fourteen years but not sixteen years may be employed or permitted to work:
(1)  During periods when the minor is not legally
required to attend school or when the minor is excused by school authorities
from attending school;
(2)  If the employer of the minor procures and keeps
on file a valid certificate of employment;
(3)  No more than five hours continuously without an
interval of at least thirty consecutive minutes for a rest or lunch period;
(4)  Between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. of any day;
provided that during any authorized school break, the minor may be employed
between 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m.;
(5)  No more than six consecutive days;
(6)  No more than eighteen hours in a calendar week
during which the minor is legally required to attend school, and no more than
forty hours in a calendar week during which the minor is not legally required
to attend school or when the minor is excused by school authorities from
attending school;
(7)  No more than three hours on any school day; and
(8)  No more than eight hours on any nonschool day.
(d)  A minor under fourteen years of age may be
employed or permitted to work in theatrical employment or in harvesting of
coffee under circumstances and conditions prescribed by the director by rule;
provided that:
(1)  The work is performed during periods when the
minor is not legally required to attend school or when the minor is excused by
school authorities from attending school;
(2)  With respect to employment in harvesting of
coffee, the director has determined after a public hearing that sufficient
adult labor to perform the work is unavailable; and
(3)  The employer of the minor procures and keeps on
file a valid certificate of employment. [L 1969, c 162, pt of §2; am L 1977, c
86, §1; gen ch 1985; am L 2003, c 61, §3]
Case Notes
Inasmuch as the protections of the infancy doctrine have been
incorporated into the statutory scheme of Hawaii's child labor law, the general
rule that contracts entered into by minors are voidable is not applicable in
the employment context; thus, trial court properly rejected plaintiff's
argument that plaintiff was entitled to disaffirm plaintiff's employment
contract, including the arbitration provision, by reason of plaintiff's
minority status.  110 H. 520, 135 P.3d 129 (2006).
