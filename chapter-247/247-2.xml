assignment, transfer, or conveyance, and shall be at the following rates:
(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (2):
(A)  Ten cents per $100 for properties with a

(B)  Twenty cents per $100 for properties with
a value of at least $600,000, but less than $1,000,000;

(A)  Fifteen cents per $100 for properties

sublease whose full unexpired term is for a period of five years or more, and
in those cases, including (where appropriate) those cases where the lease has
been extended or amended, the tax in this chapter shall be based on the cash
value of the lease rentals discounted to present day value and capitalized at
the rate of six per cent, plus the actual and full consideration paid or to be
paid for any and all improvements, if any, that shall include on-site as well
as off-site improvements, applicable to the leased premises; and provided
further that the tax imposed for each transaction shall be not less than $1. [L
