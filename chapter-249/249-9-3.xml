            <p>§249-9  Number plates; purchase.
(a) 
The number plates hereinabove referred to shall be used upon all vehicles for
which a tax has been paid pursuant to sections 249-1 to 249-13.  All number
plates shall:
(1)  If issued before January 1, 2025, bear the word
&quot;Hawaii&quot; along the upper portion of the plate and the words
&quot;Aloha State&quot; along the lower portion of the plate;
(2)  If issued on or after January 1, 2025, bear the
word &quot;Hawai`i&quot; along the upper portion of the plate and the words
&quot;Aloha State&quot; along the lower portion of the plate; provided that
both &quot;Hawai`i&quot; and &quot;Aloha State&quot; may either contain all
uppercase or lowercase letters or have the first letter of each word be
uppercase;
(3)  Have a distinct contrast between the color of the
plate and the numerals and letters thereon; and
(4)  Be of any shape, size, and color, and with any
arrangements of letters and numbers as may, subject to sections 249-1 to
249-13, be determined by the directors of finance of each county through
majority consent.
The numerals on all number plates shall be no less
than three inches in height and the strokes thereof no less than three-eighths
inch in width, except in the case of motorcycles, in which case the numerals
shall be no less than one inch in height and the strokes thereof no less than
one-eighth inch in width.
The director of finance of the city and county
of Honolulu shall contract annually on behalf of the counties for the purchase
of all number plates, tags, or emblems required.  The council of each county
shall appropriate and cause to be paid over to the party with whom the director
of finance of the city and county of Honolulu shall contract, or to the
director of finance of the city and county of Honolulu as the director may
direct, the sum or sums as the director of finance of the city and county of Honolulu
shall determine to be the county's proportionate share of the expense of the
contract and the charges connected therewith.  The contract shall be made by
the director of finance of the city and county of Honolulu as agent of the
several counties, and the proportionate liability of each county shall be
stated in the contract.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the law, the
contract shall constitute a valid obligation of each county for its
proportionate share.
(b)  The number plates for members of the
Congress of the United States from the State shall designate their office and
be of the type and color authorized for motor vehicles in the State; provided
that the number on the plates of the United States senator and the United
States representative shall be assigned in terms of seniority of service with
the senator or representative having the greater length of service having the
number &quot;1&quot; and consecutively thereafter for the others.  The director
of finance of the city and county of Honolulu shall, in the director's
procurement of the number plates on behalf of the counties, contract for the
number plates of the members of Congress and all expenses connected therewith
shall be paid by the respective members of Congress.
(c)  Notwithstanding any other provision of the
law, any antique motor vehicle shall be issued a special number plate for a fee
of $10 which plate shall be permanent and valid for use on such vehicles so
long as the vehicle is in existence in lieu of the uniform state number
plates.  The director of finance may discard and allow for new applications of
inactive special number plates that have not been assigned or registered during
the preceding three years.  In addition to the payment of any other fee required
by law, applicable to antique motor vehicles, the owner of any such vehicle
shall pay the fee for the issuance of the special number plate.  The
registration numerals and special number plates assigned to antique motor
vehicles shall be labeled &quot;Horseless Carriage&quot; and
&quot;Permanent&quot; and shall run in a separate numerical series, commencing
with Horseless Carriage No. 1. [RL 1935, pt of §2157; am L 1937, c 214, §1,

material.  Att. Gen. Op. 67‑17.
