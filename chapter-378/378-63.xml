            <p>§378-63  Civil actions for injunctive relief
or damages.
(a)  A person who alleges a violation of this part may bring a
civil action for appropriate injunctive relief, or actual damages, or both
within two years after the occurrence of the alleged violation of this part.
(b)  An action commenced pursuant to subsection
(a) may be brought in the circuit court for the circuit where the alleged
violation occurred, where the complainant resides, or where the person against
whom the civil complaint is filed resides or has a principal place of business.
(c)  As used in subsection (a),
&quot;damages&quot; means damages for injury or loss caused by each violation
of this part, including reasonable attorney fees. [L 1987, c 267, pt of §1; am
L 2002, c 56, §3]
Case Notes
Plaintiff's state whistleblower claim under §378-62 barred,
where plaintiff did not file complaint until well after the ninety-day period
after the most recent alleged violation of the whistleblowers' protection act. 
75 F. Supp. 2d 1113 (1999).
Count of complaint alleging that plaintiff was wrongfully
discharged in violation of 31 U.S.C. §3730(h) of the False Claims Act was
time-barred, where the court found that the Hawaii Whistleblowers' Protection
Act provided the state cause of action most closely analogous to a 31 U.S.C.
§3730(h) claim for retaliatory discharge, and thus applied a ninety-day statute
of limitations to plaintiff's claim for retaliatory discharge.  362 F. Supp. 2d
1203 (2005).
Plaintiff's Whistleblowers' Protection Act claim was
time-barred, where plaintiff took more than two years after the date of the
last adverse action that plaintiff identified as relevant to the lawsuit to
file suit.  938 F. Supp. 2d 1000 (2013).
