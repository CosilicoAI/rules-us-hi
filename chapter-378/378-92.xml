§378-92]  Opportunity to express
milk.
(a)  An employer shall provide:
(1)  Reasonable break time for an employee to express
milk for the employee's nursing child for one year after the child's birth each
time the employee has a need to express breast milk; and
(2)  A location, other than the restroom, that is
shielded from view and free from intrusion from coworkers and the public that
may be used by an employee to express breast milk.
(b)  Every employer covered by this section
shall post a notice in a conspicuous place accessible to employees and use
other appropriate means to keep the employer's employees informed of the
protections and obligations under this part.
(c)  Subsection (a) shall not apply to any
employer who has fewer than twenty employees if the employer can show that the
requirements under subsection (a) would impose an undue hardship by causing the
employer significant difficulty or expense in relation to the size, financial
resources, nature, or structure of the employer's business. [L 2013, c 249, pt
of §2]
