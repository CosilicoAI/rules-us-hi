            <p>§349-17  Kupuna care program.
(a)  The executive office on aging may establish the kupuna
care program.  The program shall
provide an array of long
-term services and supports to address the needs of
Hawaii's older adults to age in place
and avoid institutionalization and
to provide support services to caregivers or employed caregivers in their
efforts to assist older adults to continue residing in their homes.
(b)  The program
shall be coordinated and administered by the executive office on aging and
implemented through the area agencies on aging.
(c)  To
qualify for the kupuna care program, an individual shall be a care recipient,
caregiver, or employed caregiver as defined in section 349-16.
(d)  An area agency on aging, through the aging
and disability resource center or any other entity designated by the executive
office on aging, shall determine eligibility for the program, which may include
the following:
(1)  An intake process to preliminarily determine
eligibility for publicly funded services and supports, including kupuna care
services;
(2)  A comprehensive in-home assessment of the care
recipient or a caregiver assessment, if necessary; and
(3)
A written, individualized,
person-centered support plan that identifies all services and supports needed
or currently used to meet the needs of the care recipient, caregiver, or
employed caregiver, including those provided
by other programs such as
medicaid or privately paid programs.
(e)  An area agency on aging shall use the
assessment data and individual's support plan to confirm kupuna care program
eligibility before authorizing and coordinating services and supports.  An area
agency on aging shall authorize and allot kupuna care services and shall not
delegate the service authorization function to the agency's subcontractors.
(f)
The kupuna care
program shall be delivered through two distinct service options:  traditional
service delivery or participant-directed services and support, based on an
individualized, person-centered support plan for each eligible care recipient,
caregiver, or employed caregiver; provided that:
(1)  Traditional service
delivery shall be by a service provider that provides services to care
recipients, caregivers, and employed caregivers under a formal contractual
arrangement with the executive office on aging or applicable area agency on
aging; and
(2)  Participant-directed
services and support shall address the care recipient's assessed needs through
person-centered planning.  The care recipient shall have decision-making
authority over their own budget to purchase and manage their needed services
and supports based upon their person-centered support plan.
(g)  An individual
shall be determined to be ineligible for kupuna care services when:
(1)  The individual does not meet the eligibility
requirements specified;
(2)  The individual's need
is not substantiated through an in-home assessment;
(3)
The
individual leaves the State or the individual's whereabouts
are unknown; or
(4)
The
individual refuses services.
(h)  An area agency
on aging shall provide an individual with written notice of the disposition of
ineligibility for kupuna care services.
(i)  An individual
who has been determined ineligible for kupuna care services shall have the
opportunity to appeal the decision to the applicable area agency on aging.
(j)  Prior to
termination of kupuna care services, service providers shall notify the
applicable area agency on aging of the date and reason for termination. 
Termination of kupuna care services may occur if the care recipient, caregiver,
or employed caregiver:
(1)
Moves
and the provider is unable to locate the care recipient,
caregiver, or employed caregiver;
(2)  Is transferred to
another area agency on aging;
(3)  Dies;
(4)  No
longer
needs or wants kupuna care services and supports, or no
longer needs or wants a particular kupuna care service or support;
(5)  Is uncooperative with
the service provider;
(6)  Is noncompliant with
the basic requirements of the program;
(7)
Engages
in behavior that threatens or demonstrates violence toward
the service provider;
(8)  Is placed or resides in
a long-term care facility, such as an intermediate care facility, assisted
living facility, skilled nursing facility, hospital, community care foster
family home, adult foster home, adult residential care home, expanded adult
residential care home, or developmental disabilities domiciliary home;
(9)
Uses
comparable services from other programs; or
(10)
Has
a communicable disease that threatens the safety and
welfare of the service provider.
(k)  All area
agencies on aging shall record all consumer data, assessments, and service
delivery within a statewide consolidated database.
(l)  The kupuna care
program shall award an allocation of funds to cover costs for services, subject
to availability of funding; provided that the allocated funds shall be issued
directly to the service provider or financial management service provider upon
request and receipt of an invoice for services rendered.
(m)  The executive office on aging shall develop an
outreach plan to inform individuals of the kupuna care program and services of
the program.
(n)  The executive
office on aging shall submit an annual report to the legislature, no later than
twenty days prior to the convening of each regular session, on the kupuna care
program.  The report shall include, at minimum:
(1)
The
number of individuals who participate in the kupuna care program, including the
types of programs in which they participate; and
(2)  The number of
individuals on a program waitlist, including the types of programs for which
they are on a waitlist.
(o)  The director may
adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 necessary for the purposes of this section.
