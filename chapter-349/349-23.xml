shall be subject to any retaliatory act by the long-term care facility or any
of its employees for seeking advocacy assistance or making a complaint.
(b)  No person seeking advocacy assistance as
provided for in section [349-21] or making a complaint concerning a long-term
care facility or any of its employees on behalf of a resident of a long-term
care facility shall be subject to any retaliatory act by the long-term care
facility or any of its employees for seeking advocacy assistance or making a
complaint.
(c)  For the purposes of this section, the term
&quot;retaliatory act&quot; includes actual or threatened physical injury,
psychological abuse or neglect, sexual abuse, negligent treatment,
