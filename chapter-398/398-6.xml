            <p>§398-6  Certification.
(a)  An employer
may require that a claim for family leave be supported by written
certification.
(b)  For the birth of a child, certification
shall be issued by a health care provider or the family court.  For the placement
of a child for adoption with the employee, certification shall be issued by a
recognized adoption agency, the attorney handling the adoption, or by the
individual officially designated by the birth parent to select and approve the
adoptive family.
(c)  When leave is to care for a child, spouse,
reciprocal beneficiary, sibling, grandchild, or parent who has a serious health
condition, certification shall be issued by the health care provider of the
individual requiring care.  Certification shall be considered sufficient if it
provides information as required by the director. [L 1991, c 328, pt of §1; am
L 1995, c 154, §6; am L 2017, c 128, §3; am L 2020, c 40, §4]
