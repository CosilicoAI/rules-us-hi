            <p>§383-75  Compromise.
In case there is
at any time any dispute with respect to the liability, for any period or
periods, of any employing unit or employing units for the payment of any
contribution or contributions under this chapter which have not been paid, or
for the payment of any additional amount or amounts on account of any
contribution or contributions for such period or periods over and above the
amount or amounts theretofore paid by the employing unit or employing units,
the department of labor and industrial relations may settle and compromise the
dispute upon such terms as shall be approved by the department; provided that
if the issues involved in any such dispute have been referred to the attorney
general then no settlement and compromise thereof shall be made without the
approval of the attorney general.  Any settlement and compromise made pursuant
to this section shall be binding upon the department, and the employing unit or
employing units which are parties thereto.  Any such settlement and compromise
may include the waiver of the contributions in dispute for any portion or
portions of the period or periods in question, the waiver of any percentage of
the contribution or contributions in dispute, the waiver of interest, or the
waiver of penalties.  Any such compromise and settlement may be made prior to
or after any assessment pursuant to section 383-70 or the commencement of
proceedings under section 383-71.  Nothing in this section shall be deemed to
authorize the compromise of any issue which has become finally determined. [L
