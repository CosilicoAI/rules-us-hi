            <p>§383-126  Reimbursement of fund.
If any
moneys received after June 30, 1941, from the Secretary of Labor under
title III of the Social Security Act, or any unencumbered balances in the
employment security administration fund as of that date, or any moneys granted
after that date to the State pursuant to the Wagner-Peyser Act, are found by
the Secretary of Labor, because of any action or contingency, to have been lost
or been expended for purposes other than, or in amounts in excess of, those
found necessary by the Secretary of Labor for the proper administration of this
chapter, it is the policy of the State that such moneys shall be replaced by
moneys appropriated for such purpose from the general funds of the State to the
employment security administration fund for expenditure as provided in section
383-125.  Upon receipt of notice of such a finding by the Secretary of Labor,
the department of labor and industrial relations shall promptly report the
amount required for such replacement to the governor and the governor shall, at
the earliest opportunity, submit to the legislature a request for the
appropriation of the amount.  This section shall not be construed to relieve
the State of its obligation with respect to funds received prior to
July 1, 1941, pursuant to title III of the Social Security Act. [L 1939, c
219, §12(b); am L 1941, c 304, §1, pt of subs 34; RL 1945, §4284; am L 1953, c
