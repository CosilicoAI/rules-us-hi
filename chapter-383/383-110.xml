§383-110  Personnel security
program; criminal history record checks.]
(a)  The department shall
establish a personnel security program that ensures a background investigation
is completed at the appropriate level designated by the federal government for
any individual who will have access to federal tax information, including a
contractor and its employees or agents, if prior authority to access federal
tax information has been provided by the United States Department of the
Treasury.  This program shall include criminal history record checks in
accordance with section 846-2.7.  Information obtained pursuant to this
subsection shall be used exclusively by the department for the purpose of
determining whether the person is suitable for accessing federal tax
information in accordance with applicable federal laws.
(b)  The department may terminate or deny
employment to any employee or applicant, or terminate or refuse to secure the
services of a contractor and its employees or agents authorized under
subsection (a), if the department finds by reason of the background
investigation conducted under subsection (a) that the employee, applicant,
contractor, or contractor's employees or agents pose a risk to the security of
federal tax information.  Termination or denial of employment under this
subsection shall only occur after appropriate notification to the employee,
applicant, or contractor of the findings of the background investigation, and
after the employee, applicant, or contractor is given an opportunity to meet
and rebut the findings.  Nothing in this subsection shall abrogate any
applicable appeal rights under chapters 76 and 89, or administrative rules of
the department.
(c)  The department shall be exempt from
section 831-3.1 and need not conduct investigations, notifications, or hearings
under this section in accordance with chapter 91. [L 2017, c 132, §4]
