            <p>§383-108  Cooperation with states, etc.
(a)  The administration of this chapter and of other state and federal
unemployment compensation and public employment service laws will be promoted
by cooperation between this State and such other states and the appropriate
federal agencies in exchanging services, and making available facilities and
information.  The department of labor and industrial relations may therefore
make such investigations, secure and transmit such information, make available
such services and facilities, and exercise such of the other powers provided
herein with respect to the administration of this chapter as it deems necessary
or appropriate to facilitate the administration of any such unemployment
compensation or public employment service law, and, in like manner, accept and
utilize information, services, and facilities made available to this State by
the agency charged with the administration of any such other unemployment
compensation of public employment service law.
(b)  The courts of this State shall recognize
and enforce liabilities for unemployment contributions, interest, and penalties
imposed by other states which extend a like comity to this State.
(c)  The officials of any state which extend a
like comity to this State may bring action in the courts of this State to
collect unemployment contributions, interest, and penalties due the state.  The
certificate of the secretary of the state, or of the nearest equivalent
official, that the officials are authorized to collect the contributions,
penalties, and interest shall be conclusive evidence of the authority.
(d)  The attorney general may commence action
in any other state by and in the name of the department to collect
contributions, interest, and penalties legally due this State.
(e)  The attorney general may commence action
in this State as agent for and on behalf of any other state which extends a
like comity to this State to enforce judgments and liabilities for unemployment
contributions, interest, and penalties due the state.
(f)  If the agency which administers the
employment security law of another state has overpaid unemployment benefits to
an individual located in Hawaii and certifies to the department that the
individual is liable under its law to repay the benefits and requests the
department to recover the overpayment, the attorney general may commence action
in the courts of this State to recover the overpayment as agent for and on
behalf of the other state.  The courts of this State shall entertain the action
to collect the overpayment. [L 1941, c 304, §1, pt of subs 37; RL 1945, §4296;
RL 1955, §93-107; am L Sp 1959 2d, c 1, §27; am L 1967, c 15, §1; HRS §383-108]
