Case Notes
Under paragraph (9)(B), eligibility of a student-employee for
unemployment insurance benefits rests on whether the &quot;primary relationship&quot;
the student occupies with respect to the school, college, or university
involved is that of student or employee; under circumstances of the case, the
primary relationship claimant had to the university while claimant performed
services during the summer was that of a student of the university.  105 H.
485, 100 P.3d 55 (2004).
