individuals in its employ in one or more distinct establishments or places of
business, shall be deemed to constitute employment by an employer for all of
the purposes of this chapter for not less than two calendar years.
Upon the written approval of the election by

to this chapter from the first day of the calendar quarter in which the
approval is granted.  The services shall cease to be deemed employment subject
hereto as of January 1 of any calendar year subsequent to such two
calendar years, only if at least thirty days prior to such first day of January
