            <p>[§356D-22]  Bonds; interest rate, price, and
sale.
(a)  The bonds shall bear interest at rates payable at times that
the authority, with the approval of the governor, may determine except for
deeply discounted bonds that are subject to redemption or retirement at their
accreted value; provided that the discounted value of the bonds shall not
exceed ten per cent of any issue; and provided further that no bonds may be
issued without the approval of the director of finance and the governor. 
Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the authority may, subject to
the approval of the director of finance and the governor, issue bonds pursuant
to section 356D-21, in which the discounted value of the bonds exceeds ten
per cent of the issue.
(b)  The authority may include the costs of
undertaking and maintaining any public housing project or projects for which
the bonds are issued in determining the principal amount of bonds to be
issued.  In determining the cost of undertaking and maintaining the public
housing project, the authority may include the cost of studies and surveys;
insurance premiums; underwriting fees; financial consultant, legal, accounting,
and other services incurred; reserve account, trustee, custodian, and rating
agency fees; and interest on the bonds for a period determined by the
authority. [L 2006, c 180, pt of §2]
