            <p>[§356D-27]  Arbitrage provisions; interest
rate.
(a)  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, neither the
authority nor the director of finance shall make loans or purchase mortgages
with the proceeds of general obligation bonds of the State or from a revolving
fund established or maintained from the proceeds of bonds, at a rate of
interest or upon terms and conditions that would cause any general obligation
bond of the State or any bond to be an &quot;arbitrage bond&quot; within the
meaning of that term as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
and the regulations of the Internal Revenue Service adopted pursuant thereto.
(b)  The rate of interest on loans made under
this chapter from the proceeds of general obligation bonds of the State shall
be established by the authority, with the approval of the director of finance,
after each sale of general obligation bonds of the State, the proceeds of which
are to be used for the purposes of making loans or purchasing mortgages under
this chapter.  If no sale of general obligation bonds of the State intervenes
in a twelve-month period after the last rate fixing, the authority may review
the then existing rates on loans or mortgages made under this chapter from the
proceeds of general obligation bonds of the State and retain the existing rate
or, with the approval of the director of finance, establish different rates.
(c)  The director of finance shall approve
those rates so as to produce up to, but not in excess of, the maximum yield to
the State or the authority permitted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, and the regulations of the Internal Revenue Service adopted
pursuant thereto, on the assumption that the general obligation bonds of the
State, the proceeds of which have been or are to be used for the purposes of
making loans or purchasing mortgages under this chapter, would otherwise be
&quot;arbitrage bonds&quot; under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, and the regulations of the Internal Revenue Service adopted pursuant
thereto, were the maximum yield to be exceeded.  The establishment of the rates
of interest shall be exempt from chapter 91. [L 2006, c 180, pt of §2]
