            <p>[§356D-96]  Judicial review.
(a)  Any
person aggrieved by a final decision and order of the authority or by a
preliminary ruling of the nature that deferral of review pending entry of a
subsequent final decision would deprive the appellant of adequate relief is
entitled to judicial review thereof under this part.
(b)  Except as otherwise provided in this
section, proceedings for review shall be instituted in the circuit court within
thirty days after the preliminary ruling or within thirty days after service of
the certified copy of the final decision and order of the authority pursuant to
the rules of court, except where a statute provides for a direct appeal to the
intermediate appellate court.  In such cases, the appeal shall be treated in
the same manner as an appeal from the circuit court, including payment of the
fee prescribed by section 607‑5 for filing the notice of appeal.  The court in
its discretion may permit other interested persons to intervene.
(c)  The proceedings for review shall not stay
enforcement of the decision of the authority; provided that the authority or
the reviewing court may order a stay upon such terms as it deems proper.
(d)  Within twenty days after the determination
of the contents of the record on appeal in the manner provided by the rules of
court, or within such further time as the court may allow, the authority shall
transmit to the reviewing court the record of the proceeding under review.  The
court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the record
when deemed desirable.
(e)  If, before the date set for hearing,
application is made to the court for leave to present additional evidence and
the evidence is material and good cause exists for the failure to present the
evidence in the proceeding before the authority, the court may order the
authority to hear the evidence upon the conditions as the court deems proper. 
The authority may modify its findings, decision, and order by reason of the
additional evidence and shall file with the reviewing court, to become a part
of the record, the additional evidence, together with any modification of its
findings or decision.
(f)  The review shall be conducted by the court
without a jury and shall be confined to the record.  In cases of alleged
irregularities in procedure before the authority and not shown in the record,
testimony thereon may be taken in court.  The court, upon request by any party,
may hear oral argument and receive written briefs.
(g)  Upon review of the record, the court may
affirm the decision of the authority or remand the case with instructions for
further proceedings, or it may reverse or modify the decision and order if the
substantial rights of the petitioners may have been prejudiced because the
administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders are:
(1)  In violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions;
(2)  In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the authority;
(3)  Made upon unlawful procedure;
(4)  Affected by other error of law;
(5)  Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or
(6)  Arbitrary, capricious, or characterized by abuse
of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion. [L 2006, c 180, pt
of §2]
