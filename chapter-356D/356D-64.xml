            <p>[§356D-64]  Eviction.
(a)  If the
eviction board finds cause to terminate a lease, rental agreement, permit, or
license and evict the tenant, the authority shall provide the tenant with a
written notice of the authority's decision to terminate the tenancy.  The
written notice shall inform the tenant that a writ of possession may be issued
by the authority within ten business days.  The written notice shall also
inform the tenant whether the grounds for eviction are curable and, if so,
specify the methods to remedy the grounds, timeframe for completion, and
documentation required to prove to the authority that the grounds have been
remedied.
(b)  When the grounds for termination of the
tenancy may be cured by the tenant, the tenant shall have ten business days
from receipt of the written notice under subsection (a) to cure the grounds. 
If the grounds are cured within the ten-day period, no writ of possession shall
be issued.  If the grounds are not cured within the ten-day period, the
authority may issue a writ of possession.
(c)  The authority may adopt rules pursuant to
chapter 91 to define curable and noncurable grounds for eviction.  The
authority may consider a tenant's history in determining noncurable grounds for
eviction.  A tenant's history may include chronic or consistent delinquency, or
repeated violations of the terms of the lease, rental agreement, permit, or
license.
(d)  Enforcement of the order by a writ of
possession shall be effected either by a process server appointed by the
authority, who shall have all of the powers of a police officer for all actions
in connection with the enforcement of the order, or by a sheriff or any other
law enforcement officer of the State or any county, whose duty it shall be to
carry out the order.  The person enforcing the order shall remove all persons
from the premises and put the authority in full possession thereof.
(e)  Upon eviction, the household goods and
personal effects of the tenant against whom the order is entered, and those of
any persons using the premises incident to the tenant's holding, may be removed
from the premises and stored by the authority.  If the action is taken, the
authority shall have a lien on the property taken for the expenses incurred by
the authority in moving and storing the property, and the authority is
authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of the property if unclaimed after thirty
days. [L 2018, c 204, pt of §1]
