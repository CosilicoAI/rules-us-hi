            <p>[§356D-63]  Hearings.
(a)  When the
authority proposes to terminate a lease, rental agreement, permit, or license
and evict a tenant under section 356D-62, a hearing shall be held to determine
whether cause exists for the action.  The authority shall give written notice
to the tenant specifying the reason for the eviction and the date, time, and
place of the hearing.  The written notice shall further inform the tenant of
the right to inspect and copy the tenant's file at the tenant's expense before
the hearing is held.  The written notice shall be given at least five days
before the date of the hearing.  At the hearing, before final action is taken,
the tenant shall be entitled to be heard in person or through counsel, and
granted a full and fair hearing in accordance with the requirements of a
contested case hearing under sections 91-9 and 91-10 to 91-13.  This full and
fair hearing shall be deemed to be a contested case hearing before the
authority pursuant to chapter 91.
(b)  Hearings shall be conducted by an eviction
board appointed by the authority.  The eviction board shall consist of no fewer
than two persons, and no more than three persons, of which one member shall be
a tenant.  If feasible, the eviction board may conduct hearings using video
conferencing technology; provided that these hearings shall be conducted
pursuant to chapter 91.  The findings, conclusions, decision, and order of the
eviction board shall be final unless an appeal is taken pursuant to section 91-14.
(c)  The eviction board shall have the same
powers with respect to administering oaths, compelling the attendance of
witnesses and the production of documentary evidence, and examining witnesses,
as those of the circuit courts.  In case of a violation by any person of any
order of the eviction board, or of any subpoena issued by the eviction board,
or the refusal of any witness to testify to any matter regarding which the
witness may lawfully be questioned, a circuit court judge, upon application by
the eviction board, may compel compliance with the order or subpoena, or compel
testimony. [L 2018, c 204, pt of §1]
