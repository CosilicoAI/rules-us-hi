            <p>[§356D-62]  Termination and evictions.
(a)  Except as otherwise provided by law, the authority may terminate any
lease, rental agreement, permit, or license covering the use and occupation of
any dwelling unit or other premises located within a state low-income housing
project and evict from any premises any tenant, licensee, or other occupant for
any of the following reasons:
(1)  Failure to pay rent when due;
(2)  Violation of any provision of a lease, rental
agreement, permit, or license;
(3)  Violation of any rule of the authority;
(4)  Failure to maintain the dwelling unit in a clean,
sanitary, and habitable condition;
(5)  Upon a third violation of section 356D-6.5;
provided that a violation of paragraph (2) or (3), or this paragraph by a
person who is not a tenant, a guest who is visiting a tenant, or any member of
the tenant's household shall be deemed a violation by the tenant; or
(6)  The existence of any other circumstances giving
rise to an immediate right to possession by the authority.
(b)  When any lease, rental agreement, permit,
or license is subject to termination pursuant to subsection (a), the authority,
either directly or through its managing agent, shall provide the tenant with a
written notice that shall inform the tenant of any violation, failure, or circumstances
giving rise to an immediate right to possession by the authority and, if the
tenant has been delinquent in payment of rent, the amount of that delinquency.
