            <p>§386-100  Deductible option for medical
benefits in insurance policy.
(a)  Each workers' compensation insurance
policy issued by every insurer shall offer, at the option of the insured
employer, a deductible for medical benefits in the amount of $100, $150, $200,
$300, $400, $500, $2,500, $5,000, or $10,000, or greater if agreed upon by the
insurer and the insured employer.  The insured employer, if choosing to
exercise the option, shall choose only one of the amounts as the deductible. 
The provisions of this subsection shall be fully disclosed to the prospective
purchaser in writing.
(b)  If an insured employer exercises the
option and chooses a deductible, the insured employer shall be liable for the
amount of the deductible for the medical benefits paid for each claim of work
injury suffered by an injured employee.  The insurer shall not be liable for
the deductible.
The insurer shall pay the entire cost of
medical bills directly to the provider of services and then seek reimbursement
from the insured for the deductible amount.
Deductible medical benefit amounts shall be
reported by insurers as required by section 386-95 and shall be included in the
total average annual compensation paid by all insurance carriers in determining
the charge against employers not insured under section 386-121(a)(1) for the
purpose of the special compensation fund. [L 1985, c 296, §13; am L 1989, c
243, §1; am L 1995, c 234, §17]
