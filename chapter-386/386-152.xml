When the cash balance of the special

levy on the gross premiums of insurers of employers insured under section
386-121(a)(1) provided for in section 386-153, and the charge provided in
section 386-154 against each employer not insuring and keeping insured, as
provided in section 386-121(a)(1), shall be levied and collected during the
succeeding year and each succeeding year thereafter until the cash balance of
the fund equals or exceeds as of December 31 of any year an amount
determined by the director to be sufficient to meet the fund's current and
projected obligations.  When the cash balance of the fund equals or exceeds as
of December 31 of any year an amount determined by the director to be
sufficient to meet the fund's current and projected obligations, then the levy
on the gross premiums of insurance companies provided for in section 386-153
and the charge provided in section 386-154 against each employer not insuring
and keeping insured as provided in section 386-121(a)(1) shall not be levied
and collected during the succeeding year until the cash balance of the fund
falls below as of December 31 of any year an amount determined by the
director to be insufficient to meet the fund's current and projected
obligations.
The director shall annually furnish each
insurance company provided for in section 386-153 and each employer provided
for in section 386-154 with a copy of the certified public accountant's audit
