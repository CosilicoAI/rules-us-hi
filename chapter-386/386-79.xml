            <p>§386-79  Medical examination by employer's
physician.
(a)  After an injury and during the period of disability, the
employee, whenever ordered by the director of labor and industrial relations,
shall submit to examination, at reasonable times and places, by a duly
qualified physician or surgeon designated and paid by the employer.  The
employee shall have the right to have a physician, surgeon, or chaperone
designated and paid by the employee present at the examination, which right,
however, shall not be construed to deny to the employer's physician the right
to visit the injured employee at all reasonable times and under all reasonable
conditions during total disability.  The employee shall also have the right to
record such examination by a recording device designated and paid for by the
employee; provided that the examining physician or surgeon approves of the
recording.
If an employee refuses to submit to, or the
employee or the employee's designated chaperone in any way obstructs such
examination, the employee's right to claim compensation for the work injury
shall be suspended until the refusal or obstruction ceases and no compensation
shall be payable for the period during which the refusal or obstruction
continues.
(b)  In cases where the employer is
dissatisfied with the progress of the case or where major and elective surgery,
or either, is contemplated, the employer may appoint a physician or surgeon of
the employer's choice who shall examine the injured employee and make a report
to the employer.  If the employer remains dissatisfied, this report may be
forwarded to the director.
Employer requested examinations under this
section shall not exceed more than one per case unless good and valid reasons
exist with regard to the medical progress of the employee's treatment.  The
cost of conducting the ordered medical examination shall be limited to the
complex consultation charges governed by the medical fee schedule established
pursuant to section 386-21(c). [L 1963, c 116, pt of §1; Supp, §97-78; HRS
§386-79; gen ch 1985; am L 1995, c 234, §13; am L 1996, c 260, §4; am L 2017, c
172, §§1, 4; am L 2019, c 201, §1]
Case Notes
Labor and industrial relations appeals board's failure to
apply this section, as amended, in its decision and order constituted harmless
error, where record reflected that the reason for the 1995 medical examination
ordered by the director related directly &quot;to the medical progress of
employee's treatment&quot; in accordance with the mandate of this section as
amended.  94 H. 487, 17 P.3d 219 (2001).
