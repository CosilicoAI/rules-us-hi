            <p>§386-86  Proceedings upon claim; hearings.
(a)  If a claim for compensation is made, the director shall make such further
investigation as deemed necessary and render a decision within sixty days after
the conclusion of the hearing awarding or denying compensation, stating the
findings of fact and conclusions of law.  The director may extend the due date
for decisions for good cause provided all parties agree.  The decision shall be
filed with the record of the proceedings and a copy of the decision shall be
sent immediately to each party.
(b)  The hearing shall be informal and shall
afford the parties a full and fair opportunity to present the facts and
evidence to be considered.  Hearings under this section shall not be subject to
chapter 91.  No stenographic or tape recording shall be allowed.
(c)  The order of presentation shall not alter
the burden of proof, including the burden of producing evidence and the burden
of persuasion.  The party or parties who bear these burdens shall be determined
by law consistent with the purposes of this section.
(d)  Should the injured employee or injured
employee's representative, or the employer or employer's representative fail to
appear at the hearing, the director may issue a decision based on the
information on file.  The decision shall be final unless appealed pursuant to
section 386-87.  In all other circumstances, a decision shall not be rendered
by the director without a hearing, which may not be waived by the parties.
(e)  For the purpose of obtaining any matter,
not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending
action, the director, upon application and for good cause shown, may order the
taking of relevant testimony by deposition, upon oral examination, or written
interrogatories, or by other means of discovery in the manner and effect
prescribed by the Hawaii rules of civil procedure; provided that when the
claimant's deposition is taken, the employer shall pay for the cost to the claimant
of attending the deposition, any costs associated with having the deposition
transcribed and copied, and any and all reasonable attorney's fees and costs
incurred by the claimant with respect to the deposition.
(f)  Subpoenas requiring the attendance of
witnesses at a hearing before a hearings officer or for the taking of a
deposition or the production of documentary evidence from any place within the
State at any designated place of hearing may be issued by the director or a
duly authorized representative.  The employer shall serve a claimant with a
copy of a medical record subpoena unless the employer has previously obtained
the claimant's authorization to examine the claimant's medical records.  Should
the claimant subpoena medical records, the employer shall be served a copy. 
The party subpoenaing the records shall provide these records within fifteen
calendar days of their receipt to the employer, claimant, and the special
compensation fund if a joinder has been filed, or their representatives.  These
records shall be submitted by the party requesting the subpoena to the director
within seven calendar days of the date of the notice of hearing or upon request
by the director.  A party who desires to enforce the director's subpoena shall
seek enforcement from a court of competent jurisdiction. [L 1963, c 116, pt of
§1; Supp, §97-95; HRS §386-86; am L 1985, c 296, §8; am L Sp 2005, c 11, §8]

lacked the statutory authority either to award or to deny benefits to injured
employee.  89 H. 411, 974 P.2d 51 (1999).
