            <p>§386-195  Certificate of approval;
termination.
(a)  The certificate of approval issued by the insurance
commissioner to a workers' compensation self-insurance group authorizes the
group to provide workers' compensation benefits.  The certificate of approval
shall remain in effect until terminated at the request of the group or revoked
by the insurance commissioner pursuant to section 386-211.
(b)  The insurance commissioner shall not grant
the request of any group to terminate its certificate of approval unless the
group has insured or reinsured all incurred workers' compensation obligations
with an authorized insurer under an agreement filed with and approved in
writing by the insurance commissioner.  The obligations shall include both
known claims and expenses associated therewith and claims incurred, but not
reported, and expenses associated therewith.
(c)  Subject to the approval of the insurance
commissioner, a group may merge with another group engaged in the same or
similar type of business only if the resulting group assumes in full all
obligations of the merging groups.  The insurance commissioner may hold a
hearing on the merger and shall do so if any party, including a member of
either group, so requests. [L 1986, c 304, pt of §1]
