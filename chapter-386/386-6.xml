(a) 
This chapter shall be applicable to all work injuries sustained by employees
within the territorial boundaries of the State.

to compensation shall exclude all other liability of the employer for damages
as provided in section 386-5.  All contracts of hire of employees made within
the State shall be deemed to include an agreement to that effect.

and is entitled to compensation for the injury under the law of the state or
territory where the employee was hired, the employee shall be entitled to
enforce against the employee's employer the employee's rights in this State if
the employee's rights are such that they can reasonably be determined and dealt
with by the director of labor and industrial relations, the appellate board,
and the court in this State. [L 1963, c 116, pt of §1; Supp, §97-6; HRS §386-6;
