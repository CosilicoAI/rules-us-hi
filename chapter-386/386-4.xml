            <p>§386-4  Voluntary coverage.
Any
employer who has individuals in the employer's employment who are not employees
as defined in section 386-1 may elect to provide coverage for them under this
chapter.  During the period for which the election is effective the employer
and the individuals in the employer's employment covered thereby shall be
deemed to be employees and be subject in all respects to this chapter.
Election by any employer to provide coverage
under this chapter shall be made by securing compensation to the individuals in
the employer's employment affected thereby in the manner provided in section
386-121 and giving the notice prescribed by section 386-122.
Every employer who elects to provide coverage
under the terms of this section shall be bound by the election until
January 1 of the next succeeding year and for terms of one year
thereafter.  Any such employer may elect to discontinue the coverage for
personal injuries occurring after the expiration of any such calendar year by
filing notice of the election with the director of labor and industrial
relations at least sixty days prior to the expiration of any such calendar year
and at the same time posting notices to that effect conspicuously in such
places of work that they can reasonably be expected to come to the attention of
all individuals affected thereby. [L 1963, c 116, pt of §1; Supp, §97-4; HRS
