Period
committed.
(a) All persons committed to the Hawaii youth correctional facilities shall be
committed for the period of their minority or as otherwise ordered by the
court.  Such persons may be placed on furlough or parole if deemed
appropriate.  The power to discharge a person committed to a youth correctional
facility is reserved to the director; provided that the director shall give a
thirty-day notice of such intended discharge to the appropriate court and to
the prosecutor's office of the appropriate county.  Prior court approval for
furlough, parole, or discharge of all minors, committed by the family court to
a youth correctional facility for the period of their minority or otherwise,
shall be obtained when such is specifically required in the commitment order.
In any case, no person nineteen years or older shall be incarcerated in a youth
correctional facility.
(b)  In those cases where the term of
commitment to a youth correctional facility extends beyond the person's
nineteenth birthday, the person shall be placed on juvenile parole pursuant to
the original family court order for the balance of the person's term of
commitment; provided that such term does not extend beyond the person's
twentieth birthday unless earlier terminated. [L 1980, c 303, pt of §8(1); am L
1990, c 92, §1; am L 1997, c 325, §1; am L 1998, c 190, §1]
