Failure to
pay assessments
.  If an employer or insurer fails to pay the assessment
required by section 392-67(a) or section 392-67(b) within thirty days after the
end of the month or quarter for which payment was due, the director shall levy
a penalty of at least $250 but no more than ten per cent of the assessment due
against the employer or insurer, unless the nonpayment is excused by the
director after a showing by the employer or insurer that the payment of the
assessment could not be made on the date prescribed therefor owing to
conditions over which the employer or insurer had no control and the employer
or insurer forthwith complies.
