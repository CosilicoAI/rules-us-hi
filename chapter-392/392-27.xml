            <p>§392-27  Ineligibility in certain cases.
An individual shall not be eligible to receive temporary disability benefits:
(1)  For any period of disability during which the
individual would be disqualified from receiving benefits under the Hawaii employment
security law by reason of unemployment due to a stoppage of work existing
because of a labor dispute for the duration of such disqualification.
(2)  If the director finds that the individual has
knowingly made a false statement or representation of a fact or knowingly
failed to disclose a material fact in order to obtain benefits under this
chapter to which the individual is not otherwise entitled.  The ineligibility
shall be for a period determined by the director, but shall not exceed the
period of disability with respect to which the false statement or
representation was made or the nondisclosure occurred.
(3)  For any period of disability due to wilfully and
intentionally self-inflicted injury or to injury sustained in the commission of
a criminal offense specified in title 37.
(4)  For any day of disability during which the
employee performed work for remuneration or profit, except that, if an employee
returning to work suffers a relapse after performing work for less than a full
day, the employee shall be paid benefits or be given waiting period credit,
provided the employee's wages for the partial day's work did not equal or
exceed the prorated disability benefits to which the employee is entitled.  The
amount of the benefit payable is derived by subtracting the gross wages received
for performing less than a full day's work, from the prorated disability
benefits to which the employee is entitled.
(5)  Unless the claim for disability benefits is filed
within ninety days after the commencement of the period of disability or as
soon thereafter as is reasonably possible. [L 1969, c 148, pt of §1; am L 1971,
