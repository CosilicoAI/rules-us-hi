Rental motor vehicle and tour
vehicle surcharge tax.
(a)  There is levied and shall be assessed and
collected each month a rental motor vehicle surcharge tax of $5 a day, or any
portion of a day that a rental motor vehicle is rented or leased.  Beginning
January 1, 2022, and each subsequent year on January 1 until December 31, 2027,
the rental motor vehicle surcharge tax shall increase by $0.50.  The rental
motor vehicle surcharge tax shall be levied upon the lessor; provided that the tax
shall not be levied on the lessor if:
(1)  The lessor is renting the vehicle to replace a
vehicle of the lessee that:
(A)  Is being repaired; or
(B)  Has been stolen and is unrecovered or
will not be repaired due to a total loss of the vehicle; and
(2)  A record of the repair order, the stolen vehicle
record, or total loss vehicle claim for the vehicle is retained either by the
lessor for two years for verification purposes or by a motor vehicle repair
dealer for two years as provided in section 437B-16.
In addition to the requirements imposed by
section 251-4, a lessor shall disclose, to the department, the portion of the
remittance attributed to the county in which the motor vehicle was operated
under rental or lease.  A peer-to-peer car-sharing program, as defined in
chapter 279L, shall be subject to the tax imposed by this subsection and be
subject to the other requirements of this chapter.
(b)  There is levied and shall be assessed and
collected each month a tour vehicle surcharge tax of:
(1)  $66 for each tour vehicle used or partially used
during the month that falls into the over twenty-five passenger seat category;
and
(2)  $16 for each tour vehicle used or partially used
during the month that falls into the eight to twenty-five passenger seat
category.
The tour vehicle surcharge tax shall be levied
upon the tour vehicle operator. [L 1991, c 263, pt of §1; am L 1992, c 77, §2;
