            <p>§251-3  Certificate of registration.
(a) 
Each person as a condition precedent to engaging or continuing in the business
of providing rental motor vehicles to the public, engaging or continuing in the
tour vehicle operator business, engaging or continuing in a car-sharing
organization business, or engaging or continuing in a peer-to-peer car-sharing
program as defined in section 279L-1 shall register with the director.  A
person required to so register shall make a one-time payment of $20, upon
receipt of which the director shall issue a certificate of registration in such
form as the director determines, attesting that the registration has been
made.  The registration shall not be transferable and shall be valid only for
the person in whose name it is issued and for the transaction of business at
the place designated therein.  The registration, or in lieu thereof a notice
stating where the registration may be inspected and examined, shall at all
times be conspicuously displayed at the place for which it is issued.
(b)  The registration shall be effective until
canceled in writing.  Any application for the reissuance of a previously
canceled registration identification number shall be regarded as a new
registration application and shall be subject to the payment of the one-time
registration fee in subsection (a).  The director may revoke or cancel any
certificate of registration issued under this chapter for cause as provided by
rule under chapter 91.
(c)  If the registration fee is paid, the
department shall not refuse to issue a registration or revoke or cancel a
registration for the exercise of a privilege protected by the First Amendment of
the Constitution of the United States, or for the carrying on of interstate or
foreign commerce, or for any privilege the exercise of which, under the
Constitution and laws of the United States, cannot be restrained on account of
nonpayment of taxes, nor shall section 251-13 be invoked to restrain the
exercise of such a privilege, or the carrying on of such commerce.
(d)  Any person who may lawfully be required by
the State, and who is required by this chapter, to register as a condition
precedent to engaging or continuing in the business of providing rental motor
vehicles or tour vehicles to the public subject to taxation under this chapter,
who engages or continues in the business without registering in conformity with
this chapter, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.  Any officer or director of a
corporation who permits, aids, or abets the corporation to engage or continue
in business without registering in conformity with this chapter, shall likewise
be guilty of a misdemeanor.  The penalty for the misdemeanors shall be that
prescribed by section 231-34 for violation of that section. [L 1991, c 263, pt
of §1; am L 2014, c 110, §5; am L 2022, c 77, §3]
