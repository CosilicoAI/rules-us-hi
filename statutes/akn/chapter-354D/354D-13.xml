            <p>§354D-13  Venture agreements.
(a)  The
department, working through the correctional industries program, may enter into
venture agreements with private persons for the utilization of qualified,
able-bodied inmate labor in the manufacture, processing, or assembly of
components, finished goods, services, or product lines within facilities owned
or leased by the department, or at other sites approved by the director.  The
department may enter into agreements allowing for shared financing by the
administrator and the private contractor for the facility, equipment, raw
materials, and operation of industries developed pursuant to this section.  The
agreements shall be subject to review as to form by the attorney general and by
the advisory committee.
(b)  Qualified, able-bodied inmates producing
goods and services under the terms of an agreement authorized by this section
shall be paid on a scale to be determined by the director.  These payments
shall be distributed to offset the cost of imprisonment, incidental expenses,
restitution, child support, and to establish funds in trust for the qualified
able-bodied inmate upon release in conformance with section 354D
-

(c)  The correctional industries program may
market goods and services produced under a venture agreement to both the public
and private sectors. [L 1990, c 341, pt of §1; am L 1991, c 256, §6; am L 1992,
