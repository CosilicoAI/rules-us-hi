            <p>[§249-36]  State
mileage-based road usage charge.
(a)  Beginning July 1, 2025, in addition
to all other fees and taxes levied by this chapter, electric vehicles shall be
subject to a state mileage-based road usage charge.  The state mileage-based
road usage charge shall be
calculated
by the
county director of finance at the rate of 0.8 cents per mile traveled,
multiplied by the number of miles traveled, less the estimated amount of paid
state fuel taxes that correspond with the number of miles traveled.  The
department shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 to determine the method for
calculating the estimated amount of paid state fuel taxes that correspond with
the number of miles traveled.  The number of miles traveled shall be calculated
as the difference between the vehicle's two most recent odometer readings, as
noted on the vehicle's certificate of inspection pursuant to section 286
‑
26(e).  The state mileage-based road usage charge shall be
not less than $0, and the state mileage-based road usage charge shall be not
more than $50 per year.  For the first registration renewal of new motor
vehicles for which no certificate of inspection is required, the state mileage-based
road usage charge assessed shall be $50, and such amount once paid shall be
subtracted from the calculation of the state mileage-based road usage charge
upon that vehicle's second registration renewal.
(b)  The state
mileage-based road usage charge shall be paid each year following the vehicle's
most recent inspection together with all other taxes and fees levied by this
chapter on a staggered basis as established by each county as authorized by
section 286-51 so that the state mileage-based road usage charge is due and
payable at the same time and shall be collected together with the county
vehicle weight tax.  The state mileage-based road usage charge shall be deemed
delinquent if not paid with the county registration fee.  The respective
counties shall collect this road usage charge together with the vehicle weight
tax collected for the county and shall transfer the moneys collected under this
section to the state director of finance for deposit into the state highway
fund established under section 248-8.
(c)  Vehicles subject
to the state mileage-based road usage charge shall include all electric
vehicles in the State except for vehicles that qualify for any of the
exemptions in sections 249-4, 249-5.5, 249-6, and 249-6.5.
(d)  Until June 30, 2028, owners of electric
vehicles shall be offered a choice to pay a $50 registration surcharge in lieu
of the state mileage-based road usage charge
.
(e)  The department of transportation shall
develop a long-term mileage-based road usage charge implementation plan that
includes findings, recommendations, implementation phase schedules, and
proposed legislation for the deployment of a state mileage-based road usage
charge program to encompass all passenger vehicles and light duty trucks by
December 31, 2033.  The plan shall also include recommendations for ensuring
compatibility with the deployment of a mileage-based road usage charge by any
county and recommendations on how to ensure that broad implementation continues
to account for and incentivize more fuel-efficient vehicles.  The plan shall be
completed and submitted to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to
the convening of the regular session of 2026.
(f)  T
he department
of transportation shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 91 for establishing and
administering the state mileage-based road usage charge.
(g)  For the purposes
of this section, &quot;electric vehicle&quot; means a vehicle, with three or
more wheels, a gross vehicle weight rating less than or equal to ten thousand
pounds, and the capability to operate legally at a speed of more than thirty-five
miles per hour, that draws propulsion energy exclusively from a battery that
can be recharged from an external source of electricity. [L 2023, c 222, §2]
