the joint and several duty and responsibility of the State of Hawaii and its
counties to enable our older people to secure equal opportunity to the full and

(1)  An adequate income in retirement in accordance
with the American standard of living;
(2)  The best possible physical and mental health
which science can make available, without regard to economic status;
(3)  Suitable housing, independently selected,
designed, and located with reference to special needs and available at costs which
older citizens can afford;
(4)  Full restorative services for those who require
institutional care;
(5)  Opportunity for employment with no discriminatory
personnel practices because of age;
(6)  Retirement in health, honor, and dignity;
(7)  Pursuit of meaningful activity within the widest
range of civic, cultural, and recreational opportunities;
(8)  Efficient community services which provide social
assistance in a coordinated manner and which are readily available when needed;
(9)  Immediate benefit from proven research knowledge
which can sustain and improve health and happiness;
(10)  Freedom, independence, and the free exercise of
individual initiative in planning and managing their own lives.
(b)  In support of the declaration of purpose
in subsection (a), it shall be the policy of the State and its counties to:
(1)  Make available comprehensive programs which
include a full range of health, education, and social services to our older
residents who need them;
(2)  Give full and special consideration to older
residents with special needs in planning such programs; and, pending the
availability of such programs for all older residents, give priority to elders
with the greatest economic and social need;
(3)  Provide comprehensive programs which will assure
the coordinated delivery of a full range of essential services to our older
residents, and where applicable, also furnish meaningful employment
opportunities for individuals, including older persons from the community; and
(4)  Insure that the planning and operation of such
programs will be undertaken as a partnership of older residents, the at-large
community, and the State and its counties with appropriate assistance from the
federal government.
(c)  It shall be the duty and responsibility of
every state department and county agency providing programs and services to
elders to actively work toward the goals articulated in subsections (a) and (b)
and to employ the State's policy as included in the state master plan for
elders in the planning and implementation of their individual programs. [L
