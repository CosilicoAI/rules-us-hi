(b)  The taxes, however, are subject to the

(2)  The measure of taxes shall exempt and exclude all
sales of cigarettes and tobacco products to the United States (including any
agency or instrumentality thereof that is wholly owned or otherwise so
constituted as to be immune from the levy of a tax under this chapter), sold by
any person licensed under this chapter; and
(3)  The taxes shall be paid only once with respect to
the same cigarettes or tobacco product.  This limitation shall not prohibit the
imposition of the excise tax on receipts from sales of tobacco products under
subsection (a)(5); provided that the amount subject to the tax on each sale
shall not include amounts previously taxed under this chapter. [L 1939, c 220,
