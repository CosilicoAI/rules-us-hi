Determination of taxes;
additional assessments, credits, and refunds.
(a)  As soon as practicable
after each return shall have been filed, the department of taxation shall cause
it to be examined and shall compute and determine the amount of the taxes
payable thereon.
(b)  If it should appear upon the examination
or within five years after the filing of the return, or at any time if no
return has been filed, as a result of the examination, or as a result of any
examination of the records of the wholesaler or dealer, or of any other inquiry
or investigation, that the correct amount of the taxes is greater than that
shown on the return, or that any taxes imposed by this chapter have not been
paid, an assessment of the taxes may be made in the manner provided in section
235-108(b).  The amount of the taxes for the period covered by the assessment
shall not be reduced below the amount determined by an assessment so made,
except upon appeal or in a proceeding brought pursuant to section 40-35.
(c)  If the wholesaler or dealer has paid or
returned with respect to any month more than the amount determined to be the
correct amount of taxes for the month, the amount of the taxes so returned and
any assessment of taxes made pursuant to the return may be reduced, and any
overpayment of taxes may be credited upon the taxes imposed by this chapter, or
at the election of the wholesaler or dealer, the wholesaler or dealer not being
delinquent in the payment of any taxes owing to the State, may be refunded in
the manner provided in section 231-23(c); provided that no reduction of taxes
may be made when forbidden by subsection (b) or more than five years after the
filing of the return. [L 1939, c 220, §8; RL 1945, §5757; RL 1955, §125-7; am L
