distribution; method and manner.
(a)  Beginning January 1, 2001, a
licensee or the authorized agent or designee of a licensee shall affix a stamp

(d)  The department shall adopt rules
describing the method and manner in which stamps are to be affixed to packages
of cigarettes.
(e)  For the purpose of allowing compensation
for the costs necessarily incurred in affixing the proper tax stamps to each

or a designee of a licensee purchasing stamps from the department may purchase
the stamps at a reduction of 0.4 per cent of the denominated value of each
