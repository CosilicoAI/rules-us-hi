            <p>§256-4  Program requirements; college
account.
(a)  A college account may be opened by any person who desires to
save money for the payment of the qualified higher education expenses on behalf
of a designated beneficiary.  The person shall be considered the account owner
as defined in section 256-1.  An application for an account shall be in the
form prescribed by the program and shall contain the following:
(1)  The name, address, and social security number or
employer identification number of the account owner;
(2)  The designation of a beneficiary;
(3)  The name, address, and social security number of
the designated beneficiary;
(4)  A certification relating to no excess
contributions; and
(5)  Other information as the program may require.
(b)  Any person
or
entity, regardless of whether the person or entity is the
account owner,
may make contributions to the account after the account is opened.
(c)  Contributions to accounts may be made only
in cash.
(d)  An account owner may withdraw all or part
of the balance from an account on sixty days' notice or a shorter period as may
be authorized under rules governing the program.  The rules shall include
provisions to generally enable the determination of whether a withdrawal is a
nonqualified withdrawal or a qualified withdrawal.  The rules may require one
or more of the following:
(1)  An account owner seeking to make a qualified
withdrawal shall provide certifications of qualified higher education expenses
and other information required to comply with section 529 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or successor legislation;
(2)  Withdrawals not meeting the requirements of this
section shall be treated as nonqualified withdrawals by the program manager,
and if the withdrawals are subsequently deemed qualified withdrawals within a
reasonable time period as specified by the director of finance, the account
owner shall seek any refund of penalties directly from the program.
(e)  An account owner may change the designated
beneficiary of an account to an individual who is a member of the family of the
prior designated beneficiary.  An account owner may transfer all or a portion
of an account to another college account, the designated beneficiary of which
is a member of the same family, as defined in section 529 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or successor legislation, as the beneficiary
of the initial account.  Changes in designated beneficiaries and transfers
under this section shall not be permitted if they constitute excess
contributions.
(f)  In the case of any nonqualified withdrawal
from an account, an amount equal to ten per cent (or that rate imposed under
final regulations adopted by the Internal Revenue Service) of the portion of
the withdrawal constituting income as determined in accordance with the
principles of section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or
successor legislation, shall be collected as a penalty and paid to the college
savings program trust fund, as provided under section 529 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, successor legislation, or any guidance issued by the
Internal Revenue Service.
(g)  The percentage of the penalty described in
subsection (f) may be increased if the director of finance determines that the
amount of the penalty must be increased to constitute a greater than de minimis
penalty for purposes of qualifying the program as a qualified state tuition
program under section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or
successor legislation.
(h)  The percentage of the penalty described in
subsection (f) may be decreased by rule if it is determined the penalty is
greater than the amount required to constitute a greater than de minimis
penalty for purposes of qualifying the program as a qualified state tuition
program under section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or
successor legislation.
(i)  The program shall provide separate
accounting for each designated beneficiary.
(j)  No account owner or designated beneficiary
of any account shall be permitted to direct the investment of any contributions
to an account or the earnings on it.
(k)  Neither an account owner nor a designated
beneficiary shall use an interest in an account as security for a loan.  Any
pledge of an interest in an account shall be of no force and effect.
(l)  Contributions on behalf of a designated
beneficiary in excess of those necessary to provide for the qualified higher
education expenses of the designated beneficiary shall not be allowed.  The
prohibition on excess contributions shall conform to section 529 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or successor legislation.
(m)  If there is any distribution from an
account to any individual or for the benefit of any individual during a
calendar year, the distribution shall be reported to the Internal Revenue
Service and the account owner, the designated beneficiary, or the distributee,
to the extent required by federal law or regulation.
Statements shall be provided to each account
owner at least once each year within sixty days after the end of the
twelve-month period to which they relate.  The statement shall identify the
contributions made during a preceding twelve-month period, the total
contributions made to the account through the end of the period, the value of
the account at the end of the period, distributions made during the period, and
any other information that the director of finance requires to be reported to
the account owner.
Statements and information relating to accounts
shall be prepared and filed to the extent required by federal and state tax
law.
(n)  A local government or organization
described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, or successor legislation, may open and become the account owner of an
account to fund scholarships for persons whose identity shall be determined
upon disbursement.  Any account opened pursuant to this subsection is not
required to comply with the condition set forth in subsection (a) that a
beneficiary be designated when an account is opened, and each individual who
receives an interest in the account as a scholarship shall be treated as a
designated beneficiary.
(o)  An annual fee may be imposed upon the
account owner for the maintenance of the account.
(p)  A minimum length of time as determined by
the director of finance may be required of the account before distributions for
qualified higher education can be made.
(q)  The program shall disclose in writing the
following information to each account owner and prospective account owner of a
college account:
(1)  The terms and conditions for purchasing a college
account;
(2)  Any restrictions on the substitution of
beneficiaries;
(3)  The person or entity entitled to terminate the
tuition savings agreement;
(4)  The period of time during which a beneficiary may
receive benefits under the tuition savings agreement;
(5)  The terms and conditions under which money may be
wholly or partially withdrawn from the program, including any reasonable
charges and fees that may be imposed for withdrawal; and
(6)  The probable tax consequences associated with
contributions to and distributions from accounts. [L 1999, c 81, pt of §2; am L
2000, c 90, §3; am L 2009, c 91, §2]
