            <p>§356D-102  Facilities and services by
counties to authority and tenants.
Each county within which the authority
may own, operate, or administer any public housing project or complex and to
which, or for whose benefit, the authority or its predecessors in interest has
made (by payment to the county) or may hereafter make, gifts or donations
including any payment in lieu of taxes, upon request of the authority, shall
provide and furnish to the authority in regard to every public housing project
or complex, and to the tenants and other occupants of the public housing
project, free of charge and without condition or other requirement, all the
facilities, services, and privileges as it provides or furnishes, with or
without charge or other consideration, to any person or persons.  The
facilities and services may include police protection, fire protection, street
lighting, paving maintenance, traffic control, garbage or trash collection and
disposal, use of streets or highways, use of county incinerators or garbage
dumps, storm drainage, and sewage disposal.  In addition, each county, upon
request of the authority and free of charge and without condition or other
requirement, shall open or close, but not construct or reconstruct, streets,
roads, highways, alleys, or other facilities within any public housing project
or complex within the county.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to
restrict or limit the power of the authority to agree to pay, or to pay, for
any and all of the facilities, services, and privileges, if in its discretion
it deems the payment advisable. [L 2006, c 180, pt of §2; am L 2022, c 251, §7]
