(2)  The authority may rent or lease the dwelling

safe, sanitary, and uncongested dwelling accommodations within the area of
operation of the authority and to provide an adequate standard of living; and
(3)  The authority may rent or lease to a tenant a
dwelling consisting of the number of rooms, but no greater number, than the
authority deems necessary to provide safe and sanitary accommodations to the
proposed occupants thereof, without overcrowding.
(b)  Nothing in this part shall be construed as
limiting the power of the authority to:
(1)  Vest in an obligee the right, in the event of a
default by the authority, to take possession of a public housing project or
cause the appointment of a receiver thereof, free from all the restrictions
imposed by this part with respect to rentals, tenant selection, manner of
operation, or otherwise; or
(2)  Vest in obligees the right, in the event of a
default by the authority, to acquire title to a public housing project or the
property mortgaged by the authority, free from all the restrictions imposed by
