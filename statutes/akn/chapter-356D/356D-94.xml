            <p>[§356D-94]  Eviction.
(a)  If it is
proven to the satisfaction of the eviction board that there is cause to
terminate a lease or rental agreement and evict the tenant, the authority shall
provide the tenant with a written notice of the authority's decision to
terminate the tenancy.  The notice shall inform the tenant that a writ of
possession may be issued by the authority within ten business days.  The notice
shall also inform the tenant whether the grounds for eviction are considered
curable and, if so, what the tenant must do to remedy the grounds, by when it
must be done, and what the tenant must do to document for the authority that
the grounds have been remedied.
(b)  When the grounds for termination of the
tenancy may be cured by the tenant, the tenant shall have ten business days
from receipt of the notice provided for in subsection (a) to cure the grounds. 
If the grounds are cured within the ten-day period, no writ of possession may
be issued.  If the grounds are not cured within the ten-day period, the
authority may issue a writ of possession forthwith.
(c)  The authority may adopt rules pursuant to
chapter 91 to define curable and noncurable grounds for eviction.  The
authority may consider a tenant's history in determining noncurable grounds for
eviction.  A tenant's history may include chronic or consistent delinquency, or
repeated violations of the terms of the rental agreement.
(d)  Enforcement of the order by a writ of
possession shall be effected either by an officer appointed by the authority,
who shall have all of the powers of a police officer for all action in
connection with the enforcement of the order, or by a sheriff or any other law
enforcement officer of the State or any county, whose duty it shall be to carry
out the order.  The person enforcing the order shall remove all persons from
the premises and put the authority in full possession thereof.
(e)  Upon eviction, the household goods and
personal effects of the person against whom the order is entered, and those of
any persons using the premises incident to the person's holding, may be removed
from the premises and stored by the authority.  If the action is taken, the
authority shall have a lien on the property so taken for the expenses incurred
by it in moving and storing the same, and the authority is authorized to sell
or otherwise dispose of the property if unclaimed after thirty days. [L 2006, c
180, pt of §2]
