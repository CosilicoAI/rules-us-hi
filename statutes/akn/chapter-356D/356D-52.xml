            <p>[§356D-52]  Lien on personalty for rent,
etc.
(a)  The authority shall have a statutory lien on all personal
property, not exempt from execution, belonging to, or in the lawful possession
of, every tenant while the personal property is in or upon any state low-income
housing project, for the amount of its proper charges against the tenant for
rent of a room, dwelling unit, living quarters, or space in the state
low-income housing project, or for utilities, facilities, or services in the
state low-income housing project.  The lien shall commence with the tenancy or
occupancy of the tenant and continue for one year after the charge or charges
are due and owing to the authority.
(b)  Whenever any tenant fails or refuses to
pay the charge or charges after the same are so due and owing, the authority
shall have the right and power, acting by its authorized agents or
representatives, without process of law and without any liability for the
taking, seizure, and retention of the personal property, to take and seize any
of the personal property belonging to, or in the lawful possession of, the
tenant that is found in or upon the public housing project.  The authority may
hold and retain the property as security for the payment of the charge or
charges, until the amount of the charge or charges is paid and discharged.  If
the charge or charges, so due and owing, are not paid and discharged within
thirty days after the taking and seizure, the authority may sell the personal
property in the manner provided in section 356D-53. [L 2006, c 180, pt of §2]
