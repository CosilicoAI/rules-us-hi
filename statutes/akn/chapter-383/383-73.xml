            <p>§383-73  Penalty for delinquency; remission
. 
(a)  A penalty of ten per cent or $100, whichever is greater, shall be added to
the amount of all delinquent contributions, as hereafter defined, and any
delinquent contribution and penalty remaining unpaid fifteen days after the
date of delinquency shall bear interest from the date of delinquency at the
rate of two-thirds of one per cent for each month or fraction of a month until
paid.  Any penalty and interest assessed pursuant to this section shall be
added to the contribution and shall be collected as a part of the
contribution.  For the purposes of this section, a contribution shall be deemed
delinquent:
(1)  Upon a nonpayment thereof on the date prescribed
for its payment, but only in case of failure to pay a contribution shown due by
a return, or in case of failure to file a return, or in case of failure to pay
a contribution because of a false or fraudulent return; and
(2)  Upon nonpayment thereof within the time provided
by subsection (c) of section 383-70, in any other case.
(b)  Except in cases of
fraud or wilful violation of this chapter, or wilful refusal to make a return,
the director may, in a case of excusable failure to file a return, or pay a
contribution within the time required by this chapter, or in a case of uncollectibility
of the whole amount due, remit any amount of penalties or interest added to any
delinquent contribution
; provided that a claim of nonliability shall not be
deemed as a refusal to make a return.
(c)  The department shall keep a record of any
remittance approved by the director.
(d)  Whenever an employer makes a partial
payment of a sum owed for delinquent contributions, penalties, and interest,
the amount received by the director shall first be credited to interest, then
to penalties, and then to principal. [L 1939, c 219, §7(f); am L 1941, c 304,
