            <p>[§398-26]  Remedies.
(a)  In addition
to all employment terms and benefits provided under section 398-7, remedies
prescribed and ordered by the department or the court under this chapter may
include any legal, equitable, and other relief the department or court deems
appropriate.
(b)  Relief under this section may include:
(1)  The amount of any wages, salary, employment
benefits, or other compensation denied or lost to the employee by reason of the
violation; or
(2)  In a case in which wages, salary, employment
benefits, or other compensation have not been denied or lost to the employee,
any actual monetary losses sustained by the employee as a direct result of the
violation, such as the cost of providing care, up to a sum equal to four weeks
of wages or salary for the employee.
(c)  An employer may be liable for an
additional amount as liquidated damages equal to the sum of the applicable
amount in subsection (b)(1) and (2); provided that if an employer who has
violated this chapter proves to the satisfaction of the department or the court
that the act or omission that violated this chapter was in good faith and that
the employer had reasonable grounds for believing that the act or omission was
not a violation of this chapter, the department or the court may reduce the
amount of the liability to the applicable amount determined under subsection
(b)(1) or (2). [L 1995, c 154, pt of §3]
