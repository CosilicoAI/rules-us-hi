            <p>§392-26  Care by physician, advanced
practice registered nurse, or equivalent required.
(a)  An individual
shall be ineligible to receive temporary disability benefits with respect to
any period during which the individual is not under the care of a person duly
licensed to practice medicine, surgery, dentistry, chiropractic, osteopathy, or
naturopathic medicine, a physician assistant, or an advanced practice
registered nurse, who shall certify, in the form and manner specified by rule
of the director, the disability of the claimant, the probable duration of the
disability, and such other medical facts within the person's knowledge as
required by rule.
(b)  This section shall not apply to an
individual who, pursuant to the teachings, faith, or belief of any group,
depends for healing upon prayer or other spiritual means.  In that case the
disability, the probable duration thereof, and any other pertinent facts
required to be certified by regulation of the director shall be certified, in
the form and manner specified by the regulation, by a duly authorized or
accredited practitioner of such group.
(c)  The proof of disability duly certified by
a person licensed to practice medicine, surgery, dentistry, chiropractic,
osteopathy, or naturopathic medicine, a physician assistant, or an advanced
practice registered nurse, or an authorized or accredited practitioner of any
group that depends for healing upon prayer or other spiritual means shall be
submitted by the certifying person to the disabled employee within seven
working days after the date on which the employee was examined and found
disabled.  If the certifying person fails to submit the required proof within
seven working days, the director, upon notification by the insurer, may levy a
penalty of $25 for each delinquent certification where the certifying person
fails to show good cause for the person's failure to file on time. [L 1969, c
