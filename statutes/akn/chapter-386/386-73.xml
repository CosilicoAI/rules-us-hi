            <p>§386-73  Original jurisdiction over
controversies.
Unless otherwise provided, the director of labor and
industrial relations shall have original jurisdiction over all controversies
and disputes arising under this chapter.  The decisions of the director shall
be enforceable by the circuit court as provided in section 386-91.  There shall
be a right of appeal from the decisions of the director to the appellate board
and thence to the intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602, as
provided in sections 386-87 and 386-88, but in no case shall an appeal operate
as a supersedeas or stay unless the appellate board or the appellate court so
orders. [L 1963, c 116, pt of §1; Supp, §97-72; HRS §386-73; am L 1969, c 244,

Case Notes
This section and §386-88 supersede §91-14 and remove the
circuit court from the appellate process with regard to proceedings brought
under chapter 386.  53 H. 640, 500 P.2d 746 (1972).
&quot;Independent system of legal relations&quot; in this
chapter debars declaratory relief under chapter 632.  64 H. 380, 641 P.2d 1333
(1982).
Section does not deprive circuit court of subject matter
jurisdiction over common law tort claims not based on the original work
injury.  83 H. 457, 927 P.2d 858 (1996).
Where claimant's common law tort claims against employer's
insurer did not arise under this chapter, director did not have original
jurisdiction under this section.  83 H. 457, 927 P.2d 858 (1996).
Where claimant's complaint raised a &quot;controversy or
dispute under this chapter&quot; over which the director had original
jurisdiction, summary judgment properly granted by circuit court as court was
without jurisdiction over claim.  83 H. 457, 927 P.2d 858 (1996).
A settlement or compromise of future workers' compensation
benefits constitutes a controversy or dispute within the original jurisdiction
of the director of labor and industrial relations under this section.  90 H.
152, 977 P.2d 160 (1999).
Under §386-8, this section, and Hawaii administrative rule
§12-10-31, a settlement or compromise of future workers' compensation benefits
cannot be valid or binding without the consent or approval of the director of
labor and industrial relations.  90 H. 152, 977 P.2d 160 (1999).
Where plaintiff's claims did not arise under this chapter,
the exclusive remedy and original jurisdiction provisions in the workers'
compensation statute did not apply, and where plaintiff's claims for relief of
tortious conduct on the part of workers' compensation insurer were not within
the original jurisdiction of the labor director, trial court erred in granting
summary judgment on that basis.  90 H. 407, 978 P.2d 845 (1999).
This section and §386-87 set forth the right to appeal from
the decisions of the director in workers' compensation cases and it gives a
party the right to appeal the decision of the director in a medical fee dispute
to the labor and industrial relations appeals board; thus, the no-appeal
provision of Hawaii administrative rule §12-15-94(d) was invalid as
inconsistent with this chapter, and the director exceeded the director's
rulemaking authority in making the director's decisions in medical fee disputes
final and non-appealable.  120 H. 101 (App.), 201 P.3d 614 (2009).
Where employee appealed the director of labor and industrial
relations' (director) decision, which deferred determination of compensability
on employee's workers' compensation claim until employee complied with the
ordered independent medical examination, the labor and industrial relations
appeals board (LIRAB) was required to exercise jurisdiction over the appeal
because the LIRAB's failure to review the director's decision until entry of a
final decision on employee's entitlement to benefits would deprive employee of
adequate relief.  134 H. 99 (App.), 332 P.3d 701 (2014).
Cited:  24 H. 731, 736 (1919).
