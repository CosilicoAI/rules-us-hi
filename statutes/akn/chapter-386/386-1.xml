State employer's issuance of notice to improve performance,
which caused employee to experience a psychological injury, was not &quot;disciplinary
action&quot; as defined in this section and used in §386-3.  Therefore,
employee was not disqualified from receipt of workers' compensation benefits
under the provision in §386-3 barring claims for mental stress resulting solely
from disciplinary action taken in good faith by the employer, given that:  (1)
legislative history indicated an intent to permit mental injury claims arising
from employer actions that were part of the disciplinary process but not &quot;disciplinary
action&quot; itself because no sanction had yet been imposed; (2) notice
highlighted performance deficiencies and referred to possible sanctions at the
end of a three-month improvement period but did not impose sanctions at that
time; and (3) civil service employee performance manual stated that the notice
was not considered a disciplinary letter.  137 H. 450, 375 P.3d 229 (2016).
