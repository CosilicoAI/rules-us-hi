            <p>§386-123  Failure to give security for
compensation; penalty; injunction.
If an employer fails to comply with
section 386-121, the employer shall be liable for a penalty of not less than
$500 or of $100 for each employee for every day during which such failure
continues, whichever sum is greater, to be recovered in an action brought by
the director in the name of the State, and the amount so collected shall be
paid into the special compensation fund created by section 386-151.  The
director may, however, in the director's discretion, for good cause shown,
remit all or any part of the penalty in excess of $500; provided that the
employer in default complies with section 386-121.  With respect to such
actions, the attorney general or any county attorney or public prosecutor shall
prosecute the same if so requested by the director.
In addition, if any employer is in default
under section 386-121 for a period of fourteen days, the employer may be
enjoined, by the circuit court of the circuit in which the employer's principal
place of business is located in the State or where the violation occurred, from
carrying on the employer's business anywhere in the State so long as the
default continues, such action for injunction to be prosecuted by the attorney
general or any county attorney if so requested by the director. [L 1963, c 116,
