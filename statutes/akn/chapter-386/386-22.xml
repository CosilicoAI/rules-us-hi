            <p>§386-22  Artificial member and other aids.
Where an injury results in the amputation of an arm, hand, leg, or foot, or the
enucleation of an eye, or the loss of natural or artificial teeth, or the loss
of vision which may be partially or wholly corrected by the use of lenses, the
employer shall furnish an artificial member to take the place of each member
lost and, in the case of correctible loss of vision, a set of suitable
glasses.  Where it is certified to be necessary by a licensed physician or
surgeon chosen by agreement of the employer and the employee, the employer
shall furnish such other aids, appliances, apparatus, and supplies as are
required to cure or relieve the effects of the injury.  When a licensed
physician or surgeon, chosen as above, certifies that it is necessitated by
ordinary wear, the employer shall repair or replace such artificial members,
aids, appliances, or apparatus.
Where an employee suffers the loss of or damage
to any artificial member, aid, appliance, or apparatus by accident arising out
of and in the course of the employee's employment, the employer shall repair or
replace the member, aid, appliance, or apparatus whether or not the same was
furnished initially by the employer.
The liability of the employer for artificial
members, aids, appliances, apparatus, or supplies as is imposed by this section
shall be limited to such charges as prevail in the same community for similar
equipment of a person of a like standard of living when the equipment is paid
for by that person and shall be subject to the deductible under section
386-100. [L 1963, c 116, pt of §1; Supp, §97-21; HRS §386-22; am L 1985, c 296,
§16; gen ch 1985]
