§386-29]  Qualifying injured
employees; initial concurrent prescriptions; opioids and benzodiazepines.
(a) 
Initial concurrent prescriptions for opioids and benzodiazepines shall not be
for longer than seven consecutive days unless a supply of longer than seven
days is determined to be reasonably needed for the treatment of:
(1)  Pain experienced while the qualifying injured
employee is in post-operative care;
(2)  Chronic pain and pain management;
(3)  Substance abuse or opioid or opiate dependence;
(4)  Cancer;
(5)  Pain experienced while the qualifying injured
employee is in palliative care; or
(6)  Pain experienced while the qualifying injured
employee is in hospice care;
provided that if a health care provider authorized
to prescribe opioids issues a concurrent prescription for more than a seven-day
supply of an opioid and benzodiazepine, the health care provider shall document
in the qualifying injured employee's medical record the condition for which the
health care provider issued the prescription and that an alternative to the
opioid and benzodiazepine was not appropriate treatment for the condition.
(b)  After an initial concurrent prescription
for opioids and benzodiazepines has been made, a health care provider
authorized to prescribe opioids may authorize subsequent prescriptions through
a telephone consultation with the qualifying injured employee when the health
care provider deems such action to be reasonably needed for post-operative care
and pain management; provided that the health care provider shall consult with
a qualifying injured employee in person at least once every ninety days for the
duration during which the health care provider concurrently prescribes opioids
and benzodiazepines to the qualifying injured employee.
(c)  For the purposes of this section,
&quot;qualifying injured employee&quot; has the same meaning as in section
386-28. [L 2018, c 155, pt of §2]
