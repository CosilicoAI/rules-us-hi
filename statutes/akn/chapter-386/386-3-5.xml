            <p>§386-3  Injuries covered.
(a)  If an
employee suffers personal injury either by accident arising out of and in the
course of the employment or by disease proximately caused by or resulting from
the nature of the employment, the employee's employer or the special
compensation fund shall pay compensation to the employee or the employee's
dependents as provided in this chapter.
Accident arising out of and in the course of
the employment includes the wilful act of a third person directed against an
employee because of the employee's employment.
(b)  No compensation shall be allowed for an
injury incurred by an employee by the employee's wilful intention to injure
oneself or another by actively engaging in any unprovoked non-work related
physical altercation other than in self-defense, or by the employee's
intoxication.
(c)  A claim for mental stress resulting solely
from disciplinary action taken in good faith by the employer shall not be
allowed; provided that if a collective bargaining agreement or other employment
agreement specifies a different standard than good faith for disciplinary
actions, the standards set in the collective bargaining agreement or other
employment agreement shall be applied in lieu of the good faith standard.  For
purposes of this subsection, the standards set in the collective bargaining agreement
or other employment agreement shall be applied in any proceeding before the
department, the appellate board, and the appellate courts. [L 1963, c 116, pt
of §1; Supp, §97-3; HRS §386-3; gen ch 1985; am L 1995, c 234, §6; am L 1998, c

An employee's injury caused by a disease is compensable as an

exposure to such working conditions, and (3) is due to causes in excess of the
ordinary hazards of employment in general.  94 H. 70, 9 P.3d 382 (2000).
In order to identify the &quot;date of injury&quot; required
by the department of labor and industrial relations in connection with the
filing of a workers' compensation claim under §386-82, a claimant in a case
arising under the &quot;injury-by-disease&quot; prong of this section may rely
upon the last day of employment as the &quot;date of disability&quot;, but this
&quot;date of disability&quot; may also be the date of diagnosis of the
disabling condition.  94 H. 70, 9 P.3d 382 (2000).
Under the doctrine of substantial deviation, employee was

activity that served an important interest of the employer.  100 H. 481, 60

State employer's issuance of notice to improve performance,
which caused employee to experience a psychological injury, was not &quot;disciplinary
action&quot; as defined in §386-1 and used in this section.  Therefore,
employee was not disqualified from receipt of workers' compensation benefits
under the provision in this section barring claims for mental stress resulting
solely from disciplinary action taken in good faith by the employer, given
that:  (1) legislative history indicated an intent to permit mental injury
claims arising from employer actions that were part of the disciplinary process
but not &quot;disciplinary action&quot; itself because no sanction had yet been
imposed; (2) notice highlighted performance deficiencies and referred to
possible sanctions at the end of a three-month improvement period but did not
impose sanctions at that time; and (3) civil service employee performance
manual stated that the notice was not considered a disciplinary letter.  137 H.
450, 375 P.3d 229 (2016).
Employee's injury not compensable where employee's injury
occurred on public sidewalk outside of employer's business premises, did not
occur during a lunch or recreation period, did not occur as an incident of
employee's employment, employer did not expressly or impliedly bring
after-hours drinking party within employee's orbit of employment and party did
not benefit employer in any way.  87 H. 492 (App.), 960 P.2d 162 (1998).
An intentional tort committed by a co-employee acting in the
course and scope of his or her employment may be considered an &quot;accident&quot;,
as defined in this section, if the intentional act was directed against the
employee because of the employee's employment; and a co-employee may be
considered a &quot;third person&quot; as used in subsection (a).  128 H. 173
(App.), 284 P.3d 946 (2012).
