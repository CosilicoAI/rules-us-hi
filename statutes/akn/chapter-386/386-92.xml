            <p>§386-92  Default in payments of
compensation, penalty.
If any compensation payable under the terms of a
final decision or judgment is not paid by a self-insured employer or an
insurance carrier within thirty-one days after it becomes due, as provided by
the final decision or judgment, or if any temporary total disability benefits
are not paid by the employer or carrier within ten days, exclusive of
Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, after the employer or carrier has been
notified of the disability, and where the right to benefits are not
controverted in the employer's initial report of industrial injury or where
temporary total disability benefits are terminated in violation of section
386-31, there shall be added to the unpaid compensation an amount equal to
twenty per cent thereof payable at the same time as, but in addition to, the
compensation, unless the nonpayment is excused by the director after a showing
by the employer or insurance carrier that the payment of the compensation could
not be made on the date prescribed therefor owing to the conditions over which
the employer or carrier had no control. [L 1963, c 116, pt of §1; Supp,
§97-101; HRS §386-92; am L 1971, c 159, §1; am L 1979, c 66, §4; gen ch 1985;
am L 1995, c 234, §14]
Case Notes
Administrative penalties authorized by this section and
§386-31(b) not intended to provide an injured worker's exclusive remedy for
injuries resulting from an insurer's tortious delay or termination of
benefits.  83 H. 457, 927 P.2d 858 (1996).
Employer was not subject to penalties for failing to make
immediate payments of temporary total disability even though the claim was not
controverted in the employer's initial injury report, given that:  (1) employer
was unable to controvert claimant's shoulder injury in the initial injury
report because claimant had not complained of any shoulder injury, but employer
did controvert the shoulder injuries as soon as claimant made those claims; and
(2) holding that employer had not controverted claimant's shoulder injury for
purposes of this section merely because employer had not done so in the initial
injury report would have the effect of allowing employees to subsequently add
any injuries to their claims and prevent their employers from controverting the
additional injuries without paying a penalty.  136 H. 448, 363 P.3d 296 (2015).
