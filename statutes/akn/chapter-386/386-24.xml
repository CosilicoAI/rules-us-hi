            <p>§386-24  Medical rehabilitation.
The
medical services and supplies to which an employee suffering a work injury is
entitled shall include such services, aids, appliances, apparatus, and supplies
as are reasonably needed for the employee's greatest possible medical
rehabilitation.  The director of labor and industrial relations, on competent
medical advice, shall determine the need for or sufficiency of medical
rehabilitation services furnished or to be furnished to the employee and may
order any needed change of physician, hospital or rehabilitation facility. [L
1963, c 116, pt of §1; Supp, §97-23; HRS §386-24; gen ch 1985]
Case Notes
Neuromonics device was &quot;reasonably needed&quot; for
treating employee's work-related tinnitus in order for employee to attain the &quot;greatest
possible medical rehabilitation&quot;, where:  (1) none of the three
independent medical examiners retained by the employer had opined that the
device was not reasonably needed or had any experience with the device; (2) the
opinion of the doctor who recommended that employee be fitted with the device
was based upon experience with the device and medical expertise specifically related
to studying and treating diseases and disorders of the ear; and (3) the nature
of employee's injury and employee's treatment history established a need to
augment, albeit with a new method, fourteen years of unsuccessful strategies to
treat employee's tinnitus.  136 H. 217, 361 P.3d 444 (2015).
