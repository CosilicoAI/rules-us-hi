            <p>§386-201  Financial statements and other
reports.
(a)  Each group shall submit to the insurance commissioner a
statement of financial condition audited by an independent certified public
accountant on or before the last day of the sixth month following the end of
the group's fiscal year.  The financial statement shall be on a form prescribed
by the insurance commissioner and shall include, but not be limited to,
actuarially appropriate reserves for:
(1)  Known claims and expenses associated therewith;
(2)  Claims incurred but not reported and expenses
associated therewith;
(3)  Unearned premiums; and
(4)  Bad debts, reserves for which shall be shown as
liabilities.
An actuarial opinion regarding reserves for known
claims and expenses associated therewith and claims incurred but not reported
and expenses associated therewith shall be included in the audited financial
statement.  The actuarial opinion shall be given by a member of the American
Academy of Actuaries or other qualified loss reserve specialist as defined in
the annual statement adopted by the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners.
(b)  No person shall make any untrue statement
of a material fact in connection with the solicitation of membership of a
group.  No person shall omit to state a material fact which makes the statement
misleading, in light of the circumstances under which it is made, in connection
with the solicitation of membership of a group.
(c)  The insurance commissioner may prescribe
the format and frequency of other reports which may include, but shall not be
limited to, payroll audit reports, summary loss reports, and quarterly
financial statements. [L 1986, c 304, pt of §1]
