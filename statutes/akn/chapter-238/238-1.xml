for use in the State and that its use outside the State was not actual and
substantial;

Case Notes
&quot;Value&quot; as the fair and reasonable value may
properly include freight charges.  56 H. 621, 547 P.2d 2 (1976).
Under the plain language of this section, Delaware
corporation was not subject to the use tax where the sale of books was directly
from the corporation to the state library; the corporation did not import the
books from an unlicensed seller, nor did it purchase the books and &quot;resell&quot;
the goods to the library and thus could not have imported from itself or
purchased from itself.  103 H. 359, 82 P.3d 804 (2004).
Where plaintiff:  (1) caused consumer electronic goods from
various mainland vendors to be shipped to Hawaii in order to restock plaintiff's
retail stores in this State, constituting importation of goods into the State

property&quot; in this State &quot;for sale&quot;, plaintiff was subject to
assessment of the use tax under §238-2.  128 H. 116, 284 P.3d 209 (2012).
