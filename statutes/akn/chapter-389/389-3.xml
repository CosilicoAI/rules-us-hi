savings program for private-sector employees who do not have access to employer-sponsored
retirement plans.
(b)  The board shall consist of nine members as
follows:
(1)  Two ex officio, voting members who shall serve as
the co-chairs of the board, consisting of:
(A)  The director or the director's designee;
and
(B)  The director of finance or the director's
designee;
(2)  Two ex officio, nonvoting members, consisting of:
(A)  A member of the house of representatives
appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives; and
(B)  A member of the senate appointed by the
president of the senate; and
(3)  Five voting members who shall hold no other
public office, to be appointed by the governor and serve on the board in
accordance with section 26-34, consisting of:
(A)  One member with professional knowledge
and experience in establishing retirement savings plans and retirement
investment products;
(B)  One member representing the interests of
small businesses in Hawaii;
(C)  One member with professional knowledge
and experience in representing the interests of employers in terms of
retirement savings;
(D)  One member with professional knowledge
and experience in representing the interests of employees in terms of

(E)  One member who is a retiree who resides
