            <p>§363-5  Councils' responsibility; burial of
service members, veterans, and dependents; office of veterans' services
approval.
(a)  The councils of the counties of Hawaii, Kauai, and Maui
shall each provide for the establishment of the veterans cemetery or cemeteries
to be located within their respective counties, which includes grading,
filling, leveling, platting, paving of roadways and walks, installation of
curbs, building of fences, planting of grass, trees and shrubs, erection of
memorial buildings and monuments, and building of other necessary or convenient
structures, and shall make provisions for the maintenance and upkeep of the
cemetery or cemeteries.  The councils shall each provide for the interment of
the remains, of:
(1)  Service members who died while in the armed
forces of the United States;
(2)  Eligible veterans who entered military service
after September 7, 1980, as an enlisted person, or after October 16, 1980, as
an officer, and served a minimum of twenty-four continuous months or the full
period for which the person was called to active duty, as in the case of a
reservist;
(3)  Eligible veterans who were discharged under
conditions other than dishonorable of the armed forces of the United States
with either peacetime or wartime service; and
(4)  The wife, husband, minor children, or unmarried
disabled adult children, who predecease a service member or veteran who would
be entitled to interment, in any state veterans cemetery.
The cost of transportation of the remains to the
county of interment shall be borne by the family or estate of the deceased.
(b)  The determination of eligibility for
burial within any state veterans cemetery shall be in accordance with current
Veterans Affairs and National Cemeteries Administration Regulations.
(c)  Prior to any county action that may:
(1)  Have an adverse financial impact upon the State's
fiscal obligation to establish and maintain veterans cemeteries; or
(2)  Impair or conflict with federal requirements that
are a prescribed condition for the allocation of federal funds,
the county shall obtain approval of the action from
the office of veterans' services.  In the event of any disagreement between any
county and the office of veterans' services over whether this subsection
applies, the decision of the office of veterans' services shall control. [L
