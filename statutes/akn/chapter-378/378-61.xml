Deregulation Act of 1978.  870 F. Supp. 295 (1994).
The Act does not provide employees with a protected property
interest, as it does not create an enforceable expectation of continued public
employment.  120 F. Supp. 2d 1244 (2000).
Plaintiff could not maintain the present action where
plaintiff had agreed to &quot;forever release, acquit, and discharge&quot; the
