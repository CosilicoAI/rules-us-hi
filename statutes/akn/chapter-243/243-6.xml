approach roads thereto, and highways.  Such payments of interest and principal
on the bonds when due, shall be first charges on such moneys so deposited in
the fund.
(2)  For acquisition, designing, construction,
reconstruction, improvement, repair, and maintenance of county main and general
thoroughfares, highways, and other streets, street lights, storm drains, and
bridges, including costs of new land therefor, when expenditures for the
foregoing purposes cannot be financed under state-federal aid projects.
(3)  In the case of the city and county of Honolulu,
for payment of the city and county's share in an improvement district initiated
by the city and county for an improvement listed in [paragraph] (2) above which
is permitted to be constructed in the city and county.
(4)  For the construction of county highway tunnels,
overpasses, underpasses, and bridges, where such improvement cannot be made
