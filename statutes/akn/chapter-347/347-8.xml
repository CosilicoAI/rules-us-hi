            <p>§347-8  Workshops.
The department of
human services may also, whenever it deems proper, aid blind and visually
handicapped persons and others, who, in the opinion of the department, will be
benefited by the experience, to become self-supporting by employing them in
workshops or in their own homes at such compensation as the department may
determine their services shall warrant and by furnishing them with materials,
machinery, necessary supervision, and other help and facilities.  No person so
employed shall be deemed an employee of the State or of the department within
the meaning of this or any other chapter, or any act; provided that persons
employed in such workshops shall come under and be entitled to all the benefits
of chapter 386 relating to workers' compensation, the cost of which shall be
borne by the state insurance fund; provided further that nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent the persons so employed from being
considered employees of the State or of the department for purposes of part VI,
chapter 88, if they would be considered employees under Title II of the federal
Social Security Act, as amended. [L 1941, c 296, pt of §1; RL 1945, §4860, ren
