            <p>§348-8  State rehabilitation council.
(a)  There is established within the department a state rehabilitation
council.  The council shall consist of fifteen members appointed by the
governor as provided in section 26-34 and without regard to section 78-4.  The
members shall include:
(1)  At least one representative of a parent training
and information center;
(2)  At least one representative of the client
assistance program;
(3)  At least one qualified vocational rehabilitation
counselor with knowledge of and experience with vocational rehabilitation
programs, who shall serve as an ex officio, nonvoting member if employed by the
vocational rehabilitation division of the department;
(4)  At least one representative of community
rehabilitation program service providers;
(5)  Four representatives of business, industry, and
labor;
(6)  Representatives of disability advocacy groups
representing a cross section of individuals with physical, cognitive, sensory,
and mental disabilities, and parents, family members, guardians, advocates, or
authorized representatives of individuals with disabilities who have difficulty
in representing themselves or are unable due to their disabilities to represent
themselves;
(7)  Current or former applicants for or recipients of
vocational rehabilitation services;
(8)  At least one representative of the state
educational agency responsible for the public education of students with
disabilities;
(9)  At least one representative of the state
workforce development council; and
(10)  The administrator of the vocational
rehabilitation division of the department, who shall be an ex officio,
nonvoting member;
provided that the council shall include at least one
member from each county; and provided further that a majority of the council
members shall be persons who have disabilities and are not employed by the
vocational rehabilitation division of the department.  The council members
shall elect a chairperson from the membership.  Each member of the council
shall serve a three-year term but may not serve more than two consecutive full
terms; provided that the member representing the client assistance program shall
not be subject to term limits.
(b)  Any vacancy occurring in the council
membership shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointment,
except that the governor may delegate the authority to fill a vacancy to the
remaining members of the council after making the original appointment.  Any
vacancy on the council shall not impair the authority of the remaining members
to establish quorum by a simple majority of the remaining members and to
exercise all the powers of the council.
(c)  The council members shall serve without
compensation but shall be reimbursed for reasonable expenses, including travel
expenses, necessary for the performance of their duties.
(d)  The council, after consulting with the
state workforce development council, shall advise the vocational rehabilitation
division of the department on eligibility, order of selection, extent, scope,
and effectiveness of services provided, and performance of state agencies that
affect or that potentially affect the ability of individuals with disabilities
in achieving employment outcomes.  The council shall develop, agree to, and
review state goals and priorities, advise the vocational rehabilitation division
of the department regarding authorized activities, and assist in the
preparation of the state plan and amendments to the plan, applications,
reports, needs assessment, and evaluations.  The council shall conduct a review
and analysis of the effectiveness of, and consumer satisfaction with, the
performance by the vocational rehabilitation division of the department,
vocational rehabilitation services provided by state agencies, and other public
and private entities, and employment outcomes achieved by eligible individuals
receiving services, including the availability of health and other employment
benefits in connection with employment outcomes.  The council shall prepare and
submit an annual report to the governor on the status of vocational rehabilitation
programs within the State and make the report available to the public.
(e)  The council shall coordinate with other
councils within the State including the state council on developmental
disabilities, the state council on mental health, the advisory panel of
individuals with disabilities in education, and the state workforce development
council.  The council shall establish working relationships between the
vocational rehabilitation division of the department and other councils and
coordinate other functions as deemed appropriate under federal law.
(f)  If there is a disagreement between the
council and the vocational rehabilitation division of the department, the
disagreement shall be resolved by the governor. [L 1993, c 197, pt of §1; am L
