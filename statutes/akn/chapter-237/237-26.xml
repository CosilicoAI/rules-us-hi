subsection (b), under a contract or subcontract entered into with the United
States (including any agency or instrumentality thereof but not including
national banks), and all of the gross proceeds derived from the sale of
tangible personal property by a seller of such tangible personal property to
such contractor or subcontractor; provided the exemption herein shall apply
