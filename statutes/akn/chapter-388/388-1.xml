Revision Note
Numeric designations deleted and definitions rearranged
pursuant to §23G-15.
Case Notes
Because defendant concedes that it is contractually
responsible for managing the resorts that plaintiff employees have worked at
and had the authority to do so, there was no genuine issue of fact that
defendant &quot;permit[ted] or suffer[ed]&quot; plaintiffs to work, and was
therefore their &quot;employer&quot; under this section.  810 F. Supp. 2d 1145
(2011).
In reading §388-3 in the context of the entire statute and in
light of the common law, the trial court did not err in concluding that payment
for unused vacation upon separation from employment did not constitute
&quot;wages&quot; under the plain meaning of this section.  108 H. 411, 121
P.3d 391 (2005).
Where defendant had authority over the operation of the
hotels at which plaintiffs were employed, and defendant failed to raise an
argument regarding defendant's status as &quot;employer&quot; until after the
court had entered its final judgment, the circuit court did not err in
concluding that defendant was an &quot;employer&quot; under this chapter.  133
H. 1, 323 P.3d 792 (2014).
