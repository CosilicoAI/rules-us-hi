            <p>§353-10  Intake service centers.
(a) 
There shall be within the department of corrections and rehabilitation, an
intake service center for adults in each of the counties to screen, evaluate,
and classify the admission of persons to community correctional centers.  Each
center shall be directed and managed by a manager and shall be staffed by a
team of psychiatrists, social workers, technicians, and other personnel as may
be necessary.  The director of corrections and rehabilitation may appoint
full-time or part-time professional and clerical staff or contract for
professional services.
(b)  The centers shall:
(1)  Provide orientation, guidance, and technical
services;
(2)  Provide social-medical-psychiatric-psychological
diagnostic evaluation;
(3)  Conduct internal pretrial risk assessments on
adult offenders within three working days of admission to a community
correctional center; provided that this paragraph shall not apply to persons
subject to county or state detainers or holds, persons detained without bail,
persons detained for probation violation, persons facing revocation of bail or
supervised release, and persons who have had a pretrial risk assessment
completed prior to admission to a community correctional center.  For purposes
of this paragraph, &quot;pretrial risk assessment&quot; means an objective,
research-based, validated assessment tool that measures an offender's risk of
flight, risk of criminal conduct, and risk of violence or harm to any person or
the general public while on pretrial release pending adjudication.  The
pretrial risk assessment tool and procedures associated with its administration
shall be periodically reviewed and subject to further validation at least every
five years to evaluate the effectiveness of the tool and the procedures
associated with its administration.  The findings of periodic reviews shall be
publicly reported;
(4)
Provide correctional prescription program planning
and security classification;
(5)  Provide other personal and correctional services
as needed for both detained and committed persons;
(6)  Monitor and record the progress of persons
assigned to correctional facilities who undergo further treatment or who
participate in prescribed correctional programs;
(7)  Provide continuing supervision and control of
persons ordered to be placed on pretrial supervision by the court and persons
ordered by the director;
(8)  Make inquiry with the offender concerning the
offender's financial circumstances and include this information in the bail
report; provided that the department of corrections and rehabilitation's
pretrial services officers shall be provided limited access for the purpose of
viewing other state agencies' relevant data related to an offender's employment
wages and taxes;
(9)  Provide pretrial bail reports to the courts on
adult offenders, within three working days of admission of the offender to a
community correctional center, that are ordered by the court or consented to by
the offender.  A complete copy of the executed pretrial risk assessment
delineating the scored items, the total score, any administrative scoring
overrides applied, and written explanations for administrative scoring
overrides, shall be included in the pretrial bail report.  The pretrial bail
reports shall be confidential and shall not be deemed to be public records.  A
copy of a pretrial bail report shall be provided only:
(A)  To the defendant or defendant's counsel;
(B)  To the prosecuting attorney;
(C)  To the department of corrections and
rehabilitation;
(D)  To any psychiatrist, psychologist, or
other treatment practitioner who is treating the defendant pursuant to a court
order;
(E)  Upon request, to the adult client
services branch; and
(F)  In accordance with applicable laws,
persons, or entities doing research.  The research entity must be approved and
contracted by the department of corrections and rehabilitation to protect the
confidentiality of the information, insofar as the information is not a public
record. [L 1987, c 338, pt of §3; am L 1989, c 211, §8; am L 1996, c 130, §2;
