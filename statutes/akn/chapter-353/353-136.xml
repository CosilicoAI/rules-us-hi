(a)  There is established a special fund to be known as the automated victim

(b)  Any item purchased by an in-state or
out-of-state inmate from a correctional facility commissary shall be subject to
a four per cent surcharge on the item's price.  The proceeds from the surcharge
shall be deposited into the automated victim information and notification
system special fund.
(c)  All proceeds or revenues that are derived
from any commission that is realized pursuant to a telephone service agreement
executed by the department for the provision of telephone services for inmates
shall be deposited into the automated victim information and notification
system special fund.
(d)  Moneys received pursuant to subsections
(b) and (c) shall be used for the development and operating expenses, including
salaries and benefits of positions as authorized by the legislature, of the
system.
(e)  The sum total of all moneys expended for
development and operating expenses, including salaries and benefits of
positions as authorized by the legislature, shall not exceed the special fund
ceiling related to the fund established by the legislature; provided that the
total moneys expended for these purposes shall not exceed $600,000 in any one
fiscal year.

or deposited into, the automated victim information and notification system
special fund. [L 2012, c 190, pt of §1]
