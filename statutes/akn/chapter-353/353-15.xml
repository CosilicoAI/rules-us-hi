            <p>§353-15  Transfer of committed persons
affected with communicable disease.
Upon written recommendation of the
director of health that a committed person determined to have a communicable
disease be removed to any hospital, settlement, or place for care and treatment
of the communicable disease as designated by the director of health for such
specialized care and treatment, the director of corrections and rehabilitation
may direct any official having custody of any committed person convicted of a
felony and incarcerated in a state correctional facility to cause the committed
person to be removed to such a place as designated by the director of health,
until discharged under chapter 325 or 326 or until the maximum sentence has
been served.  Any such committed person who may be discharged before the
maximum term of imprisonment shall be returned to the state correctional
facility from which the committed person was removed.  Any such person who has
served the maximum sentence before the committed person is discharged under
chapter 325 or 326 shall remain in the custody of the director of health until
lawfully discharged or removed by direction or permission.  Supervision, care,
and treatment of the committed person transferred to any hospital, settlement,
or place for the care and treatment of the communicable disease shall be governed
by the rules, policies, and procedures of the department of health. [L 1987, c
338, pt of §3; am L 1989, c 211, §8; am L 2022, c 278, §29]
