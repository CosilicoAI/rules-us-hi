            <p>§353-8  Conditional release centers for
committed persons.
(a)  The director may establish and operate facilities
to be known as conditional release centers, either operated separately, or as
part of community correctional centers.
(b)  The purpose of such facilities is to
provide housing, meals, supervision, guidance, furloughs, and other
correctional programs for persons committed to the department of corrections
and rehabilitation and to give committed persons, in selected cases, a chance
to begin adjustment to life in a free society and to serve as a test of an
individual's fitness for release on parole.
(c)  The department shall notify the county
prosecutors and police chiefs whenever a person committed for an offense
against the person as described in chapter 707, or any convicted felon, is
admitted to a work furlough, conditional release, or similar program. 
Notification shall be transmitted in writing no later than thirty days prior to
the commencement of the program and shall list the conditions pertaining
thereto.  For parole violators who are recommitted to prison for less than
thirty days or who are placed on a work furlough, conditional release, or
similar program, notification as described above shall be transmitted in
writing on the next working day after recommitment or placement in a program.
(d)  Additionally, whenever the department
admits a committed person who has been convicted of an offense against the
person as described in chapter 707, or of an attempt to commit such an offense,
to a work furlough program, conditional release program, or other similar
programs, it shall give written notice to each victim of the offense, who has
made written request for such notice, of the admission of the committed person
to the program.  Notice shall be given to the victim at the address given on the
request for notice or such address as may be provided to the department by the
victim from time to time.  Neither the failure of any state officer or employee
to carry out the requirements of this section nor compliance with it shall
subject the State or the officer or employee to liability in any civil action. 
However, such failure may provide a basis for such disciplinary action as may
be deemed appropriate by competent authority. [L 1987, c 338, pt of §3; am L
1989, c 211, §8; am L 1992, c 64, §1; am L 1993, c 21, §1; am L 2022, c 278, §29]
