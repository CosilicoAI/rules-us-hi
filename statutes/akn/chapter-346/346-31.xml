            <p>§346-31  Assignment of persons in need of
public assistance to work on public projects.
The department of human
services as far as permissible under the then existing federal laws, may assign
persons in need of public assistance to work on state, county, or other public
projects whether or not the projects are conducted in cooperation with any
federal agency for the relief of unemployment.
The amount of assistance to be paid to such
persons shall be fixed by the department, taking into consideration the work
performed, and may exceed the amount or value of the grant of public
assistance, which would have been made had no such assignment to a work project
been made, but in no event shall such additional assistance, granted because of
assignment to a work project, exceed the amount necessary to provide for extra
expenses, incurred by the recipient for food, clothing, transportation, and incidentals.
