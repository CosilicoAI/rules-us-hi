            <p>§346-8  Additional funds.
(a)  The
department of human services may accept and deposit with the director of
finance, for use in carrying out any of the purposes of this chapter or for
costs of administration, any funds which may be provided by the United States
government, any county, or any other source, in each case upon such terms and
conditions as the department, in its discretion, may approve.  All such funds
shall be deemed additional to the funds provided by legislative appropriation. 
Any such funds received in reimbursement of expenditures made from funds
provided by legislative appropriation for any purpose are reappropriated for
the same purpose.
(b)  Except as expressly otherwise provided,
all appropriations made by the legislature shall be deemed subject to the
foregoing provisions, to the end that the amounts of such appropriations shall
be deemed to limit the amounts expendable from the general fund of the State
but not to limit the amounts expendable by the department.
(c)  The department shall submit a report
detailing all moneys received under this section to the legislature no later
than twenty days prior to the convening of each regular session. [L 1933, c
