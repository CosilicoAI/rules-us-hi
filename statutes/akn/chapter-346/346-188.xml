(a)  The department shall establish and implement a
child care accreditation program.
(b)  The department shall develop standards,
policies, and procedures for the administration of the child care accreditation
program, which shall, at minimum:
(1)  Provide upfront grant funding to cover the cost
of accreditation by one of the national early learning accrediting
organizations, as identified in section 346-184(b), or as approved by the
director;
(2)  Provide grant funding for technical assistance to
assist an eligible child care provider through the accreditation process; and
(3)  Be available to licensed group child care
centers, licensed group child care homes, licensed infant and toddler child
care centers, and registered family child care homes.
(c)  Requests for
grants shall be submitted to the department in accordance with administrative
rules adopted by the department to administer the grant program.  Each request
shall at a minimum state:
(1)  The name of the child care provider requesting
grant funds;
(2)  The expenses that are necessary for the child
care provider to obtain the accreditation; and
(3)  The age range of the children the child care
provider serves.

(8)  Is not employed by a child care facility that is
part of, owned or operated by, or owned or operated as a private educational
institution; provided that an organization or individual that owns or operates
both a private educational institution and a child care facility may apply only
if the organization or individual can provide evidence that the operations and

educational institution in violation of article X, section 1 of the Hawaii
State Constitution;

(f)  Each request for grant funds shall be
submitted to the department on an application form provided by the department
and shall at a minimum contain the information required by subsection (d).  The
department shall review each request to determine whether the applicant is
eligible to receive grant funds and shall make a final decision on each
request.  The department shall inform each grant applicant of the disposition
of the applicant's request.  The department shall adopt rules to establish an
appeals process for any denial of a request.
(g)  The department shall not release the
public funds approved for a grant under this section unless a contract is
entered into between the department and the grant recipient.  The department
shall develop and determine, in consultation with and subject to review and
approval of the department of the attorney general, the specific contract form
to be used.
(h)  Appropriations for grants made under this
section shall be subject to the allotment system generally applicable to all

(i)  Each grant contract executed pursuant to
this section shall be monitored by the department to ensure compliance with
this section, and shall be evaluated annually to determine whether the grant
attained the intended results in the manner contemplated.
(j)  Any grant recipient who withholds or omits
any material fact or deliberately misrepresents facts to the department shall
be in violation of this section and, in addition to other penalties provided by
law, any recipient found to have violated this section or the terms of any
contract executed pursuant to this section shall be prohibited from applying
for any grants awarded by the department for a period of five years from the
date of termination.
(k)  The child care accreditation program may
provide grant funding to cover incidental expenses to allow a child care
provider to receive accreditation, including but not limited to expenses for
furniture, equipment, or minor renovations.
(l)  The department may contract with a service
provider in accordance with chapters 103D and 103F, as applicable, to operate
the child care accreditation program.
(m)  The department shall adopt rules without
regard to chapter 91 to administer the child care accreditation program.
(n)  The department shall report to the
legislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of each regular
session with the number and general location of programs applying for and

begun the accreditation process or are currently accredited.
