            <p>§346-371  Annual financial audit.
(a) 
The department shall require any provider agency that dispensed shelter or
assistance for any homeless facility or any other program for the homeless
authorized by this part to submit to the department a financial audit when
requested, but at least annually.  The audit shall be conducted by a certified
public accounting firm.  This audit shall contain information specific to the
funds received under state homeless program contracts.  The audit shall include
recommendations to address any problems found.
(b)  Continuing contracts with provider
agencies to participate in any program for the homeless authorized by this part
shall require that the provider agency address the recommendations made by the
audit, subject to exceptions as set by the department.
(c)  Failure to carry out the recommendations
made by the audit may be grounds for the department to bar a provider agency
from further contracts for programs authorized by this part until the barred
provider has addressed all deficiencies. [L 2010, c 89, pt of §2; am L 2016, c
234, §4; am L 2017, c 100, §4]
