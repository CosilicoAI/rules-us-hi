            <p>§346-234  Guardian ad litem; counsel.
(a) 
In any case where the court has reason to believe that a vulnerable adult or
any other party lacks the capacity to effectively make decisions concerning the
party's person, it may appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the interests
of that party throughout the pendency of proceedings under this part.  The
court shall appoint counsel for the vulnerable adult at any time where it finds
that the vulnerable adult requires a separate legal advocate and is unable to
afford private counsel.
(b)  The court may order reasonable costs and
fees of the guardian ad litem to be paid by the party for whom the guardian ad
litem is appointed, if that party has sufficient financial resources to pay the
costs and fees.  The court may also order the appropriate parties to pay or
reimburse reasonable costs and fees of the guardian ad litem and counsel
appointed for the vulnerable adult. [L 1989, c 381, pt of §1; am L 1990, c 144,
§1 and c 234, §9; am L 2008, c 154, §16]
