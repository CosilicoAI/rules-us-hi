§346-221  Purpose; construction.
The
legislature recognizes that citizens of the State who are vulnerable to abuse
constitute a significant and identifiable segment of the population and are
particularly subject to risks of abuse, neglect, and exploitation.
The legislature recognizes that it is a
person's vulnerability, not necessarily age, which is often encountered in
cases of abuse, neglect, and exploitation.  While advanced age alone is not
sufficient reason to intervene in a person's life, the legislature finds that
many elders have become subjects of abuse, neglect, and exploitation. 
Substantial public interest exists to ensure that this segment of the
population receives protection.
The legislature declares that the State shall
develop and promote community services for the economic, social, and personal
well-being and protection of its citizens who may be vulnerable to abuse.
In taking this action, the legislature intends
to protect vulnerable adults and place the fewest possible restrictions on
personal liberty and to permit the exercise of constitutional rights by adults
consistent with protection from abuse. [L 1989, c 381, pt of §1; am L 1990, c
67, §8, c 144, §1, and c 234, §9; am L 2008, c 154, §3]
