            <p>§346-157  Liability insurance coverage; requirement.
(a)  For the purpose of this section, &quot;liability insurance coverage&quot;
means a general casualty insurance policy issued to a provider insuring against
legal liability for injury resulting from negligence to a child during the time
the child is under the care of the child care provider.
(b)  The department shall require all providers
to obtain and maintain liability insurance coverage as a condition of
licensure, temporary permission, or registration to operate a child care
facility.
(c)  The department, as a condition of
continued licensure, temporary permission, or registration, shall require all
providers to disclose in writing to each parent or guardian, within seven
working days of any change, cancellation, or termination of liability insurance
coverage, that the coverage has been changed, canceled, or terminated while the
parent's or guardian's child is cared for at the provider's facility.
(d)  The department may suspend or revoke a
license, temporary permit, or certificate of registration of a provider in
accordance with section 346-164 or 346-175, if:
(1)  The provider or any employee of the provider
knowingly makes a false statement to any person concerning the provider's
liability insurance coverage; or
(2)  The provider does not comply with the insurance
coverage and disclosure requirements of this section and rules adopted by the
department pursuant to this section.
(e)  Proof of liability insurance coverage as
required by this section shall be verified by the department on an annual
basis. [L 1986, c 298, §1; am L 2017, c 161, §2; am L 2018, c 126, §2]
