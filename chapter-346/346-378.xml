            <p>§346-378
Housing first programs.
(a)  The department of human services, in consultation with the United States
Department of Housing and Urban Development, as necessary, shall implement
housing first programs and services, as the department deems appropriate for
clientele who would most likely benefit from and succeed with the
implementation of housing first programs and services, and subject to the
availability of existing funds.
(b)  The principles of housing first include:
(1)
Moving chronically homeless individuals into
housing directly from streets and shelters, without a precondition of accepting
or complying with treatment; provided that the department may condition
continued tenancy through a housing first program on participation in treatment
services;
(2)
Providing robust support services for program
participants, predicated on assertive engagement instead of coercion;
(3)
Granting chronically homeless individuals
priority as program participants in housing first programs;
(4)
Embracing a harm-reduction approach to
addictions, rather than mandating abstinence, while supporting
program-participant commitments to recovery; and
(5)
Providing program-participants with leases and
tenant protections as provided by law.
The department of human services may contract
with housing first consultants to effectuate the purposes of this section.
(c)  Housing first programs shall incorporate
the following:
(1)  Identification of target populations,
specifically chronically homeless individuals;
(2)  Developing assessments for the chronically
homeless population;
(3)  Developing service components, including:
(A)  Financial assistance;
(B)  In-home case management services;
(C)  Affordable housing requirements;
(D)  Landlord cultivation;
(E)  Housing-placement requirements; and
(F)  Support services to move
program-participants toward self-sufficiency.
(d)  The department of human services shall
submit an annual report to the legislature no later than twenty days prior to
the convening of each regular session, beginning with the regular session of
2011.  The annual report shall include:
(1)  The total number of participants in housing first
programs;
(2)  The annual costs of the programs;
(3)  The types of support services offered; and
(4)  Information regarding the duration of services
required for each participant.
(e)  As used in this section, &quot;chronically
homeless individual&quot; means:
(1)  A homeless individual having a mental illness,
addiction, or physical disability who:
(A)  Lives in a place not meant for human
habitation, a safe haven, or an emergency shelter; and
(B)  Has been homeless and living as described
in subparagraph (A) continuously for at least twelve months or on at least four
separate occasions in the last three years; provided that the combined
occasions equal at least twelve months and each break in homelessness
separating the occasions included at least seven consecutive nights of not
living in places as described in subparagraph (A); provided further that stays
in institutional care facilities for fewer than ninety days shall not
constitute a break in homelessness, but shall be included in the twelve-month
total if the individual was living in a place not meant for human habitation, a
safe haven, or an emergency shelter immediately before entering the
institutional care facility;
(2)  An individual who has been residing in an
institutional care facility, including a jail, substance abuse or mental health
treatment facility, hospital, or other similar facility, for fewer than ninety
days and met all of the criteria in paragraph (1) before entering that
facility; or
(3)  A family with an adult head of household, or a
minor head of household if there is no adult in the family, who meets all of
the criteria in paragraph (1) or (2), including a family whose composition has
fluctuated while the head of household has been homeless. [L 2010, c 212, pt of
§2, §5; am L 2016, c 42, §6; am L 2020, c 65, §2]
