            <p>[§346-63]  Social services.
(a)  The
department shall adopt rules to provide social services pursuant to the Social
Security Act, as amended, to eligible persons who are residents of the State. 
Such rules shall include provisions to permit payment for social services
received by recipients from individuals, organizations, or other public or
private agencies, and to enable the recipients to satisfy statutory
requirements of state and federal tax and employment insurance programs.
(b)  The department may contract for the
purchase of social services to be performed for the benefit of eligible
recipients from individuals, organizations, and private or public agencies, or
to reimburse an eligible recipient for department authorized social services
obtained directly from individuals.  Persons performing authorized social
services obtained directly by the recipient shall not be considered employees
of the State.  The rate of payment for social services obtained directly by the
recipient from an individual who is not self-employed shall reflect the
recipient's obligation under state and federal tax and employment insurance
laws. [L 1978, c 110, §3]
