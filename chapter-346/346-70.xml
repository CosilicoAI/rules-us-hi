            <p>[§346-70] 
Medical assistance for other pregnant women.
(a)  The department may
provide state-funded medical assistance to a pregnant woman age nineteen years
of age or older whose countable family income does not exceed one hundred and eighty-five
per cent of the federal poverty level for a family of applicable size,
including the expected unborn children.  The pregnant woman shall be:
(1)  A legal immigrant who entered the United States
on or after August 22, 1996; and
(2)  Otherwise eligible for benefits under the State's
medicaid program but is prohibited from participating in any medical assistance
program under title XIX of the Social Security Act for a period of five years
beginning on the date of her entry into the United States, due to restricted eligibility
rules imposed by title XIX of the Social Security Act and the Personal
Responsibility and Work [Opportunity] Reconciliation Act of 1996.
(b)  Once determined eligible for medical
assistance under this section, the pregnant woman shall continue to be eligible
throughout her pregnancy and through the last day of the calendar month in
which the sixty-day period following childbirth ends.
(c)  Assets shall not be evaluated for
eligibility purposes.
(d)  The director shall adopt rules pursuant to
chapter 91 to determine eligibility for medical assistance. [L 2004, c 160, §2]
