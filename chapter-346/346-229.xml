            <p>§346-229  Right of entry.
(a)  An
employee of the department engaged in an investigation under this part shall be
authorized to visit and communicate with the vulnerable adult who is the
subject of the report.  Any person intentionally or knowingly obstructing or
interfering with the department's access to or communication with the
vulnerable adult shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
(b)  Any employee of
the department engaged in an investigation under this part, having probable
cause to
believe
that a vulnerable adult will
be injured through caregiver neglect, self-neglect, or by physical abuse before
a court order for entry can be obtained, without a warrant, may enter upon the
premises where the vulnerable adult may be found for the purpose of
ascertaining that person's welfare.  Where a warrantless entry is authorized
under
this section, the employee of the department may request
the assistance of a police officer to gain entrance.
