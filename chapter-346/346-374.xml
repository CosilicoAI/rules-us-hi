-374  Homeless shelter stipends.
(a)  The department may make or may contract to make homeless shelter stipend
payments to a provider agency operating or managing an emergency or
transitional shelter.  Under each contract, the department shall pay homeless
shelter stipends only for performance measures actually achieved by the
provider agency, such as the number of homeless families or individuals
actually provided with shelter and appropriate services at the emergency or
transitional shelter.  The contract also may include provisions for the
automatic adjustment of the homeless shelter stipend amounts, depending on
factors agreed to by the department and provider agency.
(b)  In making homeless shelter stipend
payments to a provider agency, the department may establish minimum services to
be provided by the provider agency to homeless families or individuals at the
provider agency's shelter.  The department may also direct provider agencies to
establish and manage a savings account program as described in subsection (c). 
Additionally, the department may direct provider agencies to subcontract for
outreach services from other private agencies specializing in programs for the
unsheltered homeless.
(c)  When authorized under a contract with the
department, a provider agency may establish and collect shelter and services
payments from homeless families or individuals in addition to the amount
received in homeless shelter stipend payments.  To the extent possible, the
shelter and service payment amounts established and collected by a homeless
facility, other than an emergency shelter, shall be based on the homeless
families' and individuals' ability to pay.  If collection of payments based on
ability to pay is too difficult, costly, or inefficient for the provider
agency, the payment amounts may be based on other criteria authorized under the
contract or waived partially or entirely.
Provider agencies and the department may also
set aside a portion of the payments in a savings account to be made available
to homeless families or individuals when these families and individuals vacate
the shelter.
(d)  Any state funding assistance provided to a
provider agency for compliance with the minimum requirements under section
346-374.5(b) shall be in addition to homeless shelter stipends paid to the
provider agency. [L 2010, c 89, pt of §2; am L 2016, c 234, §5; am L 2017, c
100, §4]
