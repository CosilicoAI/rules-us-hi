            <p>[§396-7]  Toxic materials.
(a)  The
department shall issue regulations requiring employers to maintain accurate
records of employee exposures to potentially toxic materials or harmful
physical agents which are required to be monitored or measured as prescribed
under the rules and regulations.
(b)  All employers shall prominently post
information regarding hazards in the employer's workplace including information
about suitable precautions, relevant symptoms, and emergency treatment in case
of exposure, and where appropriate, medical examination at no cost to employees
with the results of such medical examinations being furnished only to
appropriate state officials, and if the employee so requests, to the employee's
own physician.  Where possible, said information shall additionally be posted
or labeled on or near said hazard.  Where suitable protective equipment is
available, all employers shall provide information concerning their
availability and use to the affected employees including control or
technological procedures with respect to such hazards including monitoring or
measuring exposure.
(c)  No employee shall be permitted regular
exposure to any substance which may materially impair the employee's health or
functional capacity.
(d)  All employers shall provide prompt
information to employees when they have been or are being exposed to toxic
materials and harmful physical agents in concentrations or at levels in excess
of those prescribed in the applicable safety and health standards.  This
information may be fulfilled by:
(1)  Observation by employees of the monitoring or
measuring of such materials or agents;
(2)  Employee access to the records of such monitoring
or measuring after notice of exposure, and explanation of said monitoring or
measuring procedures where necessary;
(3)  In addition to the above, information shall be
provided to the employees of corrective action being taken. [L 1972, c 57, pt
of §1; gen ch 1985]
