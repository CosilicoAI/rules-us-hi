            <p>§388-12  Reciprocal agreements with other
states; actions.
(a)  The director of labor and industrial relations may
enter into reciprocal agreements with the labor department or corresponding
agency of any other state or with the person, board, officer, or commission
authorized to act on behalf of such department or agency, for the collection in
such other states of claims or judgments for wages and other demands based upon
claims assigned to the director.
(b)  The director may, to the extent provided
for by any reciprocal agreement entered into by law or with an agency of
another state as herein provided, maintain actions in the courts of such other
state for the collection of claims for wages, judgments, and other demands and
may assign such claims, judgments, and demands to the labor department or
agency of such other state for collection to the extent that such an assignment
may be permitted or provided for by the law of such state or by reciprocal agreement.
(c)  The director may, upon the written consent
of the labor department or other corresponding agency of any other state or of
any person, board, officer, or commission of such state authorized to act on
behalf of such labor department or corresponding agency, maintain actions in
the courts of this State upon assigned claims for wages, judgments, and demands
arising in such other state in the same manner and to the same extent that such
actions by the director are authorized when arising in this State.  However,
such actions may be maintained only in cases where such other state by law or
reciprocal agreement extends a like comity to cases arising in this State. [L
1965, c 77, §1(c); Supp, §95-11; HRS §388-12]
