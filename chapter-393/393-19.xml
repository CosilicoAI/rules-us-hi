            <p>§393-19  Freedom of collective bargaining.
(a)  In addition to the policy stated in section 393-2, nothing in this chapter
shall be construed to limit the freedom of employees to bargain collectively
for different prepaid health care coverage, if the protection provided by the
negotiated plan is more favorable to the employees benefited than the
protection provided by this chapter or at least equivalent thereto, or for a
different allocation of the costs thereof.  A collective bargaining agreement
may provide that the employer oneself undertakes to provide the health care
specified in the agreement.
(b)  If the employees rendering particular
types of services are not covered by the health care provisions of the
applicable collective bargaining agreements to which their employer is a party,
the provisions of this chapter shall be applicable with respect to them.  An
employer or group of employers shall be deemed to have complied with the
provisions of this chapter if they undertake to provide health care services
pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement and the services are available to
all other employees not covered by such agreement. [L 1974, c 210, pt of §1; am
L 1978, c 199, §2; gen ch 1993]
