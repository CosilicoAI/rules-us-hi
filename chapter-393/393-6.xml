            <p>§393-6  Principal and secondary employer
defined; coercion, interference, etc. prohibited.
If an individual is
concurrently a regular employee of two or more employers as defined in this
chapter, the principal employer shall be the employer who pays the individual
the most wages; provided that if one of the employers, who does not pay the
most wages, employs the regular employee for at least thirty-five hours per
week, the employee shall determine which of the employers shall be the
employee's principal employer.  The employee's other employers are secondary
employers.  An employer so designated as the principal employer shall remain as
such principal employer for one year or until change of employment, whichever
is earlier.
If an individual is concurrently a regular
employee of a public entity which is not an employer as defined in section
393-3 and of an employer as defined in section 393-3 the latter shall be deemed
to be a secondary employer.
An employer who, directly or indirectly,
interferes with or coerces or attempts to coerce an employee in making a
determination under this section shall be subject to the penalty provided under
subsection 393-33(b). [L 1974, c 210, pt of §1; am L 1975, c 51, §1; gen ch
