            <p>§238-5  Returns.
(a)  On or before the
twentieth day of each calendar month, any person who has become liable for the
payment of a tax under this chapter during the preceding calendar month in
respect of any property, services, or contracting, or the use thereof, shall
file a return in the form and manner prescribed by the department, setting
forth a description of the property, services, or contracting and the character
and quantity thereof in sufficient detail to identify the same or otherwise in
such reasonable detail as the director by rule shall require, and the purchase
price or value thereof as the case may be.  The return shall be accompanied by
a remittance in full of the tax, computed at the rate specified in section 238-2
or 238-2.3 upon the price or value so returned.  Any tax remaining unpaid after
the twentieth day following the end of the calendar month during which the tax
first became payable shall become delinquent; provided that a receipt from a
seller required or authorized to collect the tax, given to a taxpayer in
accordance with section 238-6, shall be sufficient to relieve the taxpayer from
further liability for the tax to which the receipt may refer, or for the return
thereof.
(b)  Notwithstanding subsection (a), a taxpayer
may be eligible to file the taxpayer's return required under this section and
make payments thereon on a quarterly or semiannual basis during the calendar or
fiscal year, the return and payment to be made on or before the twentieth day
of the calendar month after the close of each quarter or semiannual period, to
wit:
(1)  For calendar year taxpayers filing on a quarterly
basis, on or before April 20, July 20, October 20, and January 20;
(2)  For calendar year taxpayers filing on a
semiannual basis, on or before July 20, and January 20;
(3)  For fiscal year taxpayers filing on a quarterly
basis, on or before the twentieth day of the fourth month, seventh month, and
tenth month following the beginning of the fiscal year and on or before the twentieth
day of the month following the close of the fiscal year; or
(4)  For fiscal year taxpayers filing on a semiannual
basis, on or before the twentieth day of the seventh month following the
beginning of the fiscal year and on or before the twentieth day of the month
following the close of the fiscal year;
if the taxpayer possesses a valid and current permit
to file the taxpayer's general excise tax return and to make payments thereon
on a quarterly or semiannual basis issued by the director pursuant to section
237-30.  A taxpayer may also be eligible to make monthly payments based on the
taxpayer's estimated quarterly or semiannual liability with a reconciliation
return at the end of each quarter or semiannual period during the calendar or
fiscal year, as heretofore provided, if the taxpayer possesses a valid and
current permit to file quarterly or semiannual reconciliation general excise
tax returns and to make monthly payments, issued by the director pursuant to
section 237-30.
(c)  On or before the twentieth day of the
fourth month following the close of the taxable year, every person who has
become liable for the payment of taxes both under this chapter and also under
chapter 237 during the preceding calendar or fiscal year shall file a return
summarizing the person's liability under this chapter for the taxable year, in
such form as the director shall prescribe and shall file it with the person's
annual return of general excise taxes. [L 1965, c 155, pt of §2; Supp, §119-5;
