            <p>§248-9  State highway fund.
(a)  Moneys
in the state highway fund may be expended for the following purposes:
(1)  To pay the costs of operation, maintenance, and
repair of the state highway system, including without limitation, the cost of equipment
and general administrative overhead;
(2)  To pay the costs of acquisition, including real
property and interests therein; planning; designing; construction; and
reconstruction of the state highway system and bikeways, including without
limitation, the cost of equipment and general administrative overhead;
(3)  To reimburse the general fund for interest on and
principal of general obligation bonds issued to finance highway projects where
the bonds are designated to be reimbursable out of the state highway fund;
(4)  To pay the costs of construction, maintenance,
and repair of county roads; provided that none of the funds expended on a
county road or program shall be federal funds when expenditure would cause a
violation of federal law or a federal grant agreement; and
(5)  To pay the costs of establishing and maintaining a
drug and alcohol toxicology testing laboratory that is intended to support the
prosecution of offenses relating to operation of a motor vehicle while under
the influence of an intoxicant.
(b)  At any time, the director of
transportation may transfer from the state highway fund all or any portion of
available moneys determined by the director of transportation to exceed one
hundred thirty-five per cent of the requirements for the ensuing twelve months
for the state highway fund as permitted by and in accordance with section
37-53.  For purposes of the determination, the director of transportation shall
take into consideration:
(1)  The amount of federal funds and bond funds on
deposit in, and budgeted to be expended from, the state highway fund during the
period;
(2)  Amounts on deposit in the state highway fund that
are encumbered or otherwise obligated;
(3)  Budgeted amounts payable from the state highway
fund during the period;
(4)  Revenues anticipated to be received by and
expenditures to be made from the state highway fund during the period based on
existing agreements and other information for the ensuing twelve months; and
(5)  Any other factors as the director of
transportation shall deem appropriate.
(c)  The department of transportation shall
establish county subaccounts within the state highway fund.  Notwithstanding
subsections (a) and (b), funds in each county subaccount shall be expended for
state highway road capacity projects in the respective county.
For purposes of this subsection, &quot;state
highway road capacity project&quot; means construction:
(1)  Of a new road;
(2)  To widen or add additional lanes to an existing
road; or
(3)  That increases the number of vehicles that may be
driven on an island and alleviates the level of traffic congestion on existing
roads of that island,
and any planning, design, or right-of-way
acquisition related to the construction. [L 1932 1st, c 19, pt of §12; am imp L
