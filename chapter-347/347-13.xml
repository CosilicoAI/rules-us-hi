            <p>§347-13  Persons who are blind, visually
handicapped, disabled; public places; public conveyances.
(a)  Persons who
are blind, visually handicapped, or otherwise disabled are entitled to full and
equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges of all common
carriers, airplanes, motor vehicles, railroad trains, motor buses, street cars,
boats, or any other public conveyances or modes of transportation, hotels,
lodging places, places of public accommodation, amusement, or resort, and other
places to which the general public is invited, subject only to the conditions
and limitations established by law and applicable to all persons.
(b)  Every person who is blind, deaf, visually
handicapped, or otherwise disabled shall have the right to be accompanied by a
service animal, especially trained for the purpose of assisting the person in
any of the places listed in subsection (a) without being required to pay an
extra charge for the service animal; provided that the person shall be liable
for any damage done to the premises or facilities by the service animal.  No

condition that requires the use of a life jacket or other flotation device; and

licensed physician, physician assistant, or advanced practice registered nurse attesting
to the person's need to use a life jacket or other flotation device.
