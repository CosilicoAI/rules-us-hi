            <p>[§389-5]  Hawaii retirement savings program;
due diligence; establishment; payroll deduction upon election to contribute.
(a)  There is established within the department, for administrative purposes
only, a Hawaii retirement savings program.  The program shall be administered
by the board, in consultation with the department and the department of budget
and finance.  The board may determine the time frame for development and
implementation of the program; provided that prior to implementation of the
program, the board shall meet the requirements of subsections (b) and (c).
(b)  Prior to implementation of the program,
the board may conduct a detailed implementation and evaluation study and
perform other due diligence tasks to determine the feasibility of the program
parameters established by this chapter and the resources and time needed to
implement the program.  Upon completion of the study, the board shall report
its findings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation and
funding requirements, to the legislature.
(c)  Upon submittal of its report to the
legislature pursuant to subsection (b) and prior to implementation of the
program, the board may determine the level of staffing necessary to implement
the program, develop an implementation strategy and timetable, and conduct
outreach efforts to potential covered employers and covered employees.
(d)  Any covered employee may elect to
contribute a portion of the employee's salary or wages to an individual
retirement account provided by the program through payroll deduction.
(e)  Beginning on a date to be determined by
the board pursuant to subsection (a), a covered employer shall:
(1)  Allow a covered employee to enroll into the
program after providing the covered employee with a written notice of the
employee's right to opt in; and
(2)  For any covered employee who has opted in to the
program:
(A)  Withhold the covered employee's
contribution amount from the employee's salary or wages; and
(B)  Transmit the covered employee's payroll
deduction contribution to the program on the earliest date the amount withheld
can reasonably be segregated from the covered employer's assets, but no later
than the fifteenth day of the calendar month following the month in which the covered
employee's contribution amounts are withheld.
(f)  The program shall establish for each
enrolled employee a Roth IRA, into which the contributions deducted from an
employee's payroll shall be deposited.  The board may add an option for all
participants to affirmatively elect to contribute to a traditional IRA in
addition to a Roth IRA.
(g)  The contributions to and earnings on the
amounts contributed to an employee's IRA under the program shall be owned by
the employee.  The State and employers shall have no proprietary interest in
the contributions or earnings in an employee's IRA.
(h)  Covered employers shall not make
contributions, whether matching or not, to the program.
(i)  The board may authorize matching
contributions of up to $500 per participant account from the special fund for
the first 50,000 covered employees who participate in the program for twelve
consecutive months after initial enrollment. [L 2022, c 296, pt of §2]
